### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-03-28T18:34:41.099Z)

Please post any discrepancies related to project1.

[@carlton](/u/carlton)

## Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?

All the image ids we evaluated were what _you_ submitted to us. This is the
list of docker repos that was given to us by [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) as the
official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will
only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the
repos _you_ gave us.

For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We
will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker
repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No
other image id will be evaluated.

## How to fix bugs in our scripts

Create Pull requests to [Jivraj-18/tds-
jan25-project1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1) .

## Bug fixes

If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks
because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts
and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.

highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.

We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on
assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such
circumstances.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-28T19:12:51.933Z)

You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was
graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not
produce consistent results.

### Dhruv (2025-03-28T19:14:57.376Z)

I have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my
email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which
is `ARM`. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and
threw the `exec format error`.

This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be
evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Content:** The image contains a single, centered, white letter "D" against a
muted, gray-blue background. The letter "D" is in a simple, sans-serif font
and appears to have a slight 3D effect, achieved through subtle shading or a
bevel. The background color is uniform and without any noticeable textures or
patterns. **Key elements:** * **Letter "D":** The central subject. * **Color
scheme:** White against a gray-blue backdrop. * **Font:** Sans-serif, simple
and clean. * **Effect:** Apparent 3D effect on the letter, likely due to
shading or bevel. * **Composition:** Centered letter, simple background. This
minimalist design emphasizes the letter itself.] 22f3002933:

[@carlton](/u/carlton) same issue, My image was also run on a `x86_64`
architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can
see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error`
and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.

Actually my image was run on x86_64 architecture as it was present in that log
file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.

I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the
instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall,
especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some
questions, which I believe led to those failures.

Would you mind reviewing the evaluation.log screenshot I have attached? I
believe I may deserve marks for Task B6. [@carlton](/u/carlton), could you
kindly take a look?  

[[Image description: The image shows the result of a test case, labeled "B6",
that has failed. Here's a breakdown: * **Header:** The image begins with "HTTP
200 'Scraped data saved to ./data/b6.json'". This likely indicates a
successful HTTP request that scraped data and saved it to the specified JSON
file. * **HTTP Request:** "HTTP Request: GET
http://localhost:8052/read?path=/data/b6.json 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK'" indicates a
GET request to a local server at port 8052, attempting to read the contents of
the "data/b6.json" file. The "200 OK" suggests the server successfully
responded to the request. * **/data/b6.json:** Identifies the specific file
being tested. * **EXPECTED vs. RESULT:** The image highlights the "EXPECTED"
and "RESULT" sections, indicating a comparison between the expected data and
the actual data retrieved from the JSON file. * **EXPECTED:** The "EXPECTED"
section displays a list of author names in a JSON array format. Some names
appear to be repeated. * **RESULT:** The "RESULT" section presents a JSON
object with a key called ".author" which holds an array of author names. The
author names in this list match those in the "EXPECTED" list. * **X B6
FAILED:** At the bottom of the image, the "X B6 FAILED" confirms the failure
of the test case. **Analysis of the Failure:** The "EXPECTED" value does not
appear to be a valid JSON object as it has an incorrect key in the expected
output. This is why the test is failing.]image1460×585 24.9

### Debjeet Singha (2025-03-28T20:59:57.711Z)

can you please take a look at this screenshot?  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image's content:
**Overall Structure:** The image presents a log or report of a task being
executed and tested. It appears to be related to processing an image
(potentially containing a credit card) and extracting information using a
Language Model (LLM). The log shows various stages of the task, including
requests, responses, and a comparison of expected and actual results.
**Textual Elements and Analysis:** * **"A7 PASSED"**: Indicates the task or
test case A7 has passed, usually signifying successful execution. * **"Running
task..."**: Describes the task's objective: It involves processing an image
located at `/data/card.jpg`, identifying a credit card, using an LLM to
extract the card number, and storing the extracted number without spaces in a
file named `/data/cc-number.txt`. * **"HTTP Request: POST..."**: Represents an
HTTP POST request sent to `http://localhost:8001/run?`. The `task` parameter
in the URL likely contains the instructions for the LLM, encoded within the
URL. The URL-encoded string includes parts like: * `/data/card.jpg` (the input
image path) * "has a credit card" (likely part of a description for the LLM) *
"Pass+the+image+to+an+LLM" (instructs to process by LLM) *
"extract+the+card+number" (instructions to extract) * `/data/cc-number.txt`
(output file path for the extracted number) * **"HTTP 200" block**: Contains
the response to the POST request. The `"result"` field confirms the extraction
task was completed successfully. * **"HTTP Request: GET..."**: Represents an
HTTP GET request sent to `http://localhost:8001/read?path=/data/cc-
number.txt`. This request is likely to retrieve the content of the `/data/cc-
number.txt` file (i.e., the extracted card number). * **"/data/cc-
number.txt"**: Indicates that this portion of the log is related to the
content/verification of the output file. * **"EXPECTED:"**: Specifies the
expected card number: `6011598665215965`. * **"RESULT:"**: Presents the
extracted card number by the LLM: `6011598656215965`. **Key Observations:** *
**Error Indication**: The red circle next to `/data/cc-number.txt` suggests
there may be an issue. * **Discrepancy**: The "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" card
numbers are different. Specifically, the 9th digit of the extracted card
number is different from the expected, 6 instead of 5. **In summary, the image
depicts a task that involves extracting a credit card number from an image
using an LLM. The task ran successfully, but the extracted card number does
not match the expected value, indicating an error in the extraction process.**

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Please correct me if I’m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks **B7** , **B8** ,
and **B10** , the evaluation log does not include any **`POST` or `GET`
request traces**, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request
flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only
the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or
that the output file was read.  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content,
focusing on text, objects, and relevant features: **Overall Structure** The
image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal or similar output, showing the
results of a series of HTTP requests and tasks. It includes status messages,
code snippets, and error messages. **First Block: HTTP Request & Response
(Task B6 - Author Extraction)** * **HTTP Request:** A POST request to
`http://localhost:8278/run`. The `task` parameter appears to be a URL-encoded
string, describing the task of extracting authors from a website containing
quotes. Specifically, it targets `quotes.toscrape.com`. The aim is to extract
author names from the first page and save them as an array of strings in a
file named `/data/b6.json`. * **HTTP Response:** * Status code: `HTTP/1.1 200
OK` (success). * The response includes: * `"status": "success"`: Confirms the
successful execution of the task. * `"task"`: A textual description of the
task, reiterating the extraction of authors and saving them to
`/data/b6.json`. * `"generated_code"`: The Python code used to perform the
task. This code uses the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `json` libraries. It
retrieves the content from `https://quotes.toscrape.com/`, parses the HTML,
finds elements with class "author", extracts the author's name, and saves the
list of author names to `/data/b6.json`. There's an error handling block
included. * `"output": ""`: Indicates no standard output was generated by the
code. **Second Block: HTTP Request & Response (Task B6 - Reading JSON Data)**
* **HTTP Request:** A GET request to
`http://localhost:8278/read?path=/data/b6.json`. This attempts to read the
JSON data saved in the previous step. * Status indicator: B6 PASSED (green
checkmark). **Third Block: Task B7 - Image Processing** * **Description:**
"Running task: Download the image at
`https://dummyimage.com/100x100/ad0434/ad0434.png`, resize it to 50x50 px and
save it to `/data/b7.png`". * The goal is to download an image from the
specified URL, resize it to 50x50 pixels, and save the processed image.
**Fourth Block: Errors** * **B7 failed:** Shows a red X, indicating the image
processing task (B7) failed. * **B8 failed:** Shows a red X, indicating an
error. The error message: "not all arguments converted during string
formatting." **Summary of Errors** * **B7 FAILED:** The image download,
resize, and save task failed. * **B8 FAILED:** A string formatting error
occurred, meaning there's likely a problem in the code where variables are not
being correctly inserted into a string. Let me know if you would like a deeper
dive into any specific section! ]image2003×745 95

Hi @all

We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86
platform.

We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time,
before pushing to the dashboard.

[Image could not be described] 23f3003302:

> Hi [@jivraj](/u/jivraj),

[@23f3003302](/u/23f3003302) output from your server’s response is correct, we
will update our evaluation script.

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image depicts a solitary figure sitting in a meditative
posture (likely cross-legged) in a natural setting. The scene is characterized
by strong contrasts between light and shadow, and a mystical or surreal
atmosphere. **Key Features:** * **Figure:** A silhouetted person is sitting in
a contemplative pose. The details of the figure are obscured by darkness,
emphasizing their isolation and introspection. * **Light Source:** The central
element of the image is a bright, spherical or ovoid light source. It glows
intensely, illuminating the area immediately surrounding the figure and
casting long shadows. * **Background:** The background consists of a blend of
natural elements, possibly a mountain range, a forest, or rocky terrain. The
colors are predominantly dark blues, purples, and blacks, which contribute to
the night-time atmosphere. * **Other colors:** There are reddish or orange
hues emanating from the ground, potentially indicating a campfire, lava, or
another source of warm light reflecting upwards. **Interpretation:** The image
evokes themes of introspection, contemplation, and the search for inner peace.
The light source might symbolize enlightenment, knowledge, or a source of
guidance. The lone figure suggests a journey of self-discovery or a moment of
solitude and reflection. If you have specific questions about the image,
please let me know, and I can provide more targeted information.] 23f2004912:

### Pritul Santosh Raut  (2025-03-29T03:17:56.348Z)

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the
log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my
project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that
defines the path using the `os` library. As a result, all file evaluations
returned errors such as “can’t read the file.”

I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to
reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of
the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files
remained unchecked or resulted in errors.

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Impression:** The image shows a screen capture of a web browser
displaying a log file. The log file seems to contain error messages and status
updates related to a software program or system. The context appears to be
some kind of automated evaluation or testing process, possibly related to a
coursework assignment. **Key Text and Features:** * **File Name:**
"24f1002555@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\\_evaluation.log" This indicates that the log
file likely belongs to a student with the ID '24f1002555' at the Indian
Institute of Technology Madras (IITM). The file name also points to it being
related to an evaluation or grading. * **Error Messages:** The log contains
several error messages, which are indicative of issues the system is
encountering: * **HTTP 500 Errors:** These errors suggest internal server
problems. They are accompanied by detail messages like: * `"detail": "500:
(Errno 2) No such file or directory: '/app./data/mail.txt"` * `"detail": "500:
(Errno 2) No such file or directory: './data/card.jpg"` * `"HTTP/1.1 500
Internal Server Error"` * **HTTP 404 Errors:** These errors indicate that a
requested resource was not found: * `"HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"` * `"A7 failed:
Cannot read /data/mail-sender.txt"` * `"A8 failed: Cannot read /data/cc-
number.txt"` * **"FAILED" Indicators:** Red "X" symbols accompanied by
"FAILED" text highlight specific task failures. * **Tasks and Descriptions:**
The log describes several tasks that the system is attempting to perform: *
"Running task: '/data/card.jpg' has a credit card. Pass the image to an LLM,
extract the card number, and write it without spaces to '/data/cc-number.txt'"
This suggests the system is trying to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to
extract credit card information from an image. * "Running task:
'/data/comments.txt' contains a list of comments, one per line. Using
embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to
'/data/comments-similar.txt', one per line" This indicates a task involving
natural language processing, where the system finds similar comments using
embeddings. * **HTTP Requests:** The log shows HTTP requests being made,
including: * `GET http://localhost:8138/read?path=/data/mail-sender.txt` *
`GET http://localhost:8138/read?path=/data/cc-number.txt` * `POST
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings` * `POST
http://localhost:8138/run?task=$60%2Fdata%2Fcomments.txt...` * **URL:** The
URL in the address bar is
`drive.google.com/file/d/1Te0WdJaRAYUQc7shZrO2bBFWhOZO92ca/view` indicating
that the log file is stored on Google Drive. **Interpretation:** The image
captures a debugging view of a system attempting various tasks. It reveals
problems related to file access (e.g., "No such file or directory"), internal
server errors during image processing, and potential issues with accessing
resources on a local server. The 'FAILED' tags indicate problems with
processing images and accessing data. The use of an LLM and embeddings
suggests this is a project related to data processing and AI. ]Screenshot

I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86_64 architecture (as indicated
by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM
architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and
resulted in an exec format error.

be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the
appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks
because of such an error feels wrong

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-29T04:39:03.187Z)

[@23f2001975](/u/23f2001975) we had to rely on docker telling us whether an
image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us.
If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we
ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and
identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.

If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it
on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our
evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely
create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating
students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the
bug fix.

We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who
requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.

Kind regards

You have a misspelling in your environment variable, thats why it failed. We
do pass the token to your docker exactly as specified in Project 1 page.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-29T05:08:12.916Z)

We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your
project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a
sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for
students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is
serious about working in this field.

Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a
difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling
us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not
tell us that. So we will re run those.

If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.

Kind regards

I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:

    
    
    {
    "detail": "'choices'"
    }
    

This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before
submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY_TOKEN. Could you
please look into this?

Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System
Commands team in their email.

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on

### Sakthivel S (2025-03-29T05:24:12.600Z)

I encountered the same issue with `evaluate.py`. However, since you previously
advised against coding strictly with `evaluate.py`, I didn’t pursue it
further. Now, I’m concerned—how is this a mistake?

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image's content:
**Overall Layout** The image displays what appears to be a text output from a
computer system, likely a log file or test result. It shows a comparison
between an "EXPECTED" output and a "RESULT" output. At the top is the file
path `/data/logs-latest.txt`, and at the bottom, an "X A5 FAILED" message,
indicating a failure. **Text Content** The image has a considerable amount of
text organized into three sections: 1\. **File Path:** `/data/logs-latest.txt`
(at the top) 2\. **EXPECTED:** This section lists what the expected output
from a process or test should be. The text appears to be sentences consisting
of relatively common words strung together, potentially used as sample text or
test data. 3\. **RESULT:** This section presents the actual output from a
process or test. The text in this section is nearly identical to the
"EXPECTED" section. 4\. **FAILED Message:** "X A5 FAILED" (at the bottom),
indicating a failure of test case "A5". **Key Features** * **"▲ EXPECTED:"**
This label signifies the anticipated or desired outcome of a process. * **"▲
RESULT:"** This label signifies the actual outcome of a process. * **"X A5
FAILED"** This label at the end indicates that the A5 test has failed. *
**Text Similarities:** The "EXPECTED" and "RESULT" sections contain very
similar, if not identical, text. This suggests that the test was designed to
produce the exact same output as its expected value, and any difference would
cause a failure. **Interpretation** The image shows the results of a test
where the actual result did not match the expected result. The specific test
case is labeled "A5". The nearly identical text in the "EXPECTED" and "RESULT"
sections suggests a very strict comparison is being performed. ]Screenshot

yaa same issue i am also facing ,  
and this LLM thing is very new for us , and we tried our best to complete. ,
but because of local machine issue , or anything , people end up getting 0
marks , or 4-5 marks , ..  
As a lot of students are getting 0 , so please give some bonus , or some
marking for there efforts ,  
TDS dont have quiz , ,and getting 0 in project will decrease our CGPA too .  
please think for it sir [@carlton](/u/carlton)

Please, look over it.

Also, in my docker log file, it is showing the error as:  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall:** The image shows a server log, indicating an error encountered
while running an application. The log is primarily textual, filled with
information about the application's execution, function calls, API responses,
and traceback error messages. **Key Sections and Textual Content:** 1\.
**Startup Information:** * "INFO: Started server process [1]" * "INFO: Waiting
for application startup." * "INFO: Application startup complete." * "INFO:
Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)" - indicates the
server is running Uvicorn, an ASGI web server. 2\. **Task Information:** *
"INFO:root:Inside run task with task: Say Hello Carlton" - Shows that the
application is attempting to perform a task named "Say Hello Carlton." *
Several lines of "INFO:root: PRINTING RESPONSE:::" suggest repeated attempts
to print or log a response. 3\. **Function Call Details:** * "INFO: root:
Inside execute\\_function\\_call with function\\_call: {'name':
'extract\\_specific\\_text\\_using\\_llm', 'arguments': {'input\\_file':
'system\\_input.txt', 'output\\_file': 'output.txt', 'task': 'Say Hello
Carlton'}}" - The application is attempting to execute a function called
"extract\\_specific\\_text\\_using\\_llm" (likely a Large Language Model
interaction function). It's passing arguments like 'input\\_file' set to
"system\\_input.txt" and 'output\\_file' set to "output.txt". 4\. **API
Response/LLM Output:** * A large JSON-like structure describes the API
response (likely from an LLM provider). It includes: * 'id', 'object',
'created', 'model' - Standard API response fields. * 'choices' - A list
containing the LLM's response. Crucially, the 'content' field is 'None', but
there are 'tool\\_calls'. This signifies that the LLM generated a tool call
instead of direct text. * 'tool\\_calls' - A list of tool calls, indicating
the LLM wants to use other functions. Here, it tries to use
"extract\\_specific\\_text\\_using\\_llm" (the same function it's currently
inside). It tries to call this function twice. * 'usage' - Token usage
statistics (prompt tokens, completion tokens, total tokens). * 'costError':
"crypto.createHash is not a function'" - This error suggests there may be a
compatibility issue within the software. 5\. **Error Messages and
Tracebacks:** * "Calling function: extract\\_specific\\_text\\_using\\_llm" -
Confirms the attempt to execute the LLM interaction function. * "Arguments:
{'input\\_file': 'system\\_input.txt', 'output\\_file': 'output.txt', 'task':
'Say Hello Carlton'}" - Repeats the arguments for clarity. * "INFO:
172.17.0.1:33072 - "POST /run?task=Say+Hello+Carlton HTTP/1.1" 500 Internal
Server Error" - Indicates a 500 Internal Server Error response from the
server. * "ERROR: Exception in ASGI application" - Confirms an error in the
ASGI application. * A "Traceback" section follows, showing the path of the
error. The critical line is: * "FileNotFoundError: \\[Errno 2] No such file or
directory: 'system\\_input.txt'" - The core issue: the "system\\_input.txt"
file cannot be found. * There are several subsequent "During handling of the
above exception, another exception occurred:" blocks, meaning the initial
`FileNotFoundError` led to further errors higher up in the call stack,
propagating the issue. **Interpretation and Problem:** The root cause of the
problem is that the "system\\_input.txt" file, which the
"extract\\_specific\\_text\\_using\\_llm" function needs as input, is not
found at the specified path. This file might be missing, incorrectly named, or
not accessible to the application in its current environment. This leads to an
error when attempting to open the file with `open(input_file_path, "r") as
file:`. The application then throws an exception, ultimately resulting in a
500 Internal Server Error. It appears that the issue may be with the software
itself. ]Screenshot 2025-03-29 at 11.10.03 AM2360×1582 503

Yes, I agree.  
So, did my docker ID change when I submitted?  
I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project,
so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not
mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really
don’t know where I have went wrong.

Jivraj Sir had checked liked this for another student, so I just wanted to
confirm the same for me.

used correct image id. Here is repo

### Shashannk (2025-03-29T06:23:39.304Z)

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) !

I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation
of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks,
dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly.
During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working
as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the
tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!

Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my
project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in
real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if
there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work
deserves another review.

The error occurs because Python cannot find the `tasksA` module. This is due
to the file not existing, not being in the correct directory.

> This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 468630ef32b8

We evaluated you on correct file

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on the text and its context: **Context:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a terminal session, likely on a Linux-based system, involving Docker commands. **Commands and Output:** 1\. **`docker pull --platform arm64 rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3`**: * This is a Docker command to pull (download) a Docker image from a registry. * `--platform arm64`: Specifies that the image should be built for the ARM64 architecture (commonly used in mobile devices and embedded systems). * `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3`: This is the name of the Docker image, broken down as follows: * `rohit23f1001156`: This is likely the username or organization name under which the image is hosted in a Docker registry (like Docker Hub). * `project1_tds`: This is the image name. * `:v3`: This specifies the tag (version) of the image. In this case, it's version 3. 2\. **`v3: Pulling from rohit23f1001156/project1_tds`**: This indicates that the pull process is starting and specifies from where. 3\. **`Digest: sha256:bd2d0e570ec6b9a4a2b1565602a7c6abd118c4df06ca39e9dd78b0c06cab7542`**: * This shows the SHA256 hash (a unique identifier) of the image layer that was pulled. Digests are used to verify the integrity of the image. 4\. **`Status: Downloaded newer image for rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3`**: * This confirms that the image was successfully downloaded. The "newer image" part suggests that this user might have already had a version of this image locally and this pull updated it. 5\. **`docker.io/rohit23f1001156/project1_tds:v3`:** This is the full name (with registry prefix) of the image. 6\. **`docker images | grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"`**: * `docker images`: This command lists all Docker images available locally on the system. * `|`: This is a pipe, which takes the output of the `docker images` command and passes it as input to the next command. * `grep "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds"`: This command filters the output of `docker images` to only show lines that contain the string "rohit23f1001156/project1_tds". 7\. **`rohit23f1001156/project1_tds v3 468630ef32b8 5 weeks ago 581MB`**: * This is the output of the `docker images` command, filtered by `grep`. It displays information about the image: * `rohit23f1001156/project1_tds`: The image name. * `v3`: The image tag (version). * `468630ef32b8`: The image ID (a short, unique identifier). * `5 weeks ago`: Indicates how long ago the image was created or last updated. * `581MB`: The size of the image. **Other:** * The prompt `usr_22f3002542_ds_study_iitm_ac_@tds-course-temp-bq:~$` shows the username, hostname, and current directory in the terminal. It indicates that this session is potentially within a course or educational environment. * The green color scheme is a common terminal configuration. ]image1757×250 24.9 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/7/d73b7915b1fb24bc215068e0695616f82f122f96.png "image")

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Content:**
The image shows a single letter "R" in white, centered against a deep reddish-
pink background. The "R" appears to have a slight 3D effect or a soft glow
around it, giving it a subtle pop from the background. **Text:** The only text
present is the letter "R". **Objects/Features:** * **Letter "R":** The
dominant object is the letter "R." Its font style is fairly simple and
legible. * **Color Palette:** The image uses a limited color palette. The main
colors are white and a reddish-pink, which provides a strong contrast. *
**Texture/Glow:** There appears to be a slight soft glow or a subtle gradient
around the letter "R," contributing to its visual prominence. *
**Perspective:** The view is straight on, with no angled perspective. This
simple design suggests the image could be used as an icon, a logo element, or
a visual representation of something beginning with the letter "R."]

No no sir, I can send you an SS of my code, it’s very much there sir, the
tasksA file, i really don’t know why this happened.  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on
the relevant elements: **Overall Impression:** The image appears to be a
screenshot of the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) integrated development
environment (IDE). It showcases a project folder with various files and the
command prompt/terminal window. **Key Elements & Text:** * **File
Explorer/Project Structure:** * The left side of the screen shows the project
directory structure. * Files visible in the directory include: * `pip.exe`,
`pip3.13.exe`, `pip3.exe`, `python.exe`, `pythonw.exe` (Python executables and
related files) * `.gitignore` (Git ignore file) * `pyvenv.cfg` (Python virtual
environment configuration file) * `.dockerignore` (Docker ignore file) *
`.env` (Environment variables file) * `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`,
`tasksA.py` (Python script files) * `docker-compose.deb...` and `docker-
compose.yml` (Docker Compose files) * `Dockerfile` (Docker image definition
file) * `requirements.txt` (List of Python dependencies) * The `app.py` file
is highlighted, indicating it is likely the currently selected or open file. *
**Editor Window:** * The right side of the screen shows a portion of the code
editor. * Line numbers are visible (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22). * The word
"PROBLEMS" is visible which indicates potential issues in the program. *
**Terminal/Command Prompt:** * The bottom right shows a terminal window. * It
displays a path: `C:\Users\Ri...`. * The text indicates `(tds_roe) C` which
likely signifies that a virtual environment named `tds_roe` is activated
within the terminal. * "*History" is visible, suggesting access to command
history. * "O PS C:\Users" is displayed. * **VS Code Interface Elements:** *
"OUTLINE" and "TIMELINE" are visible as collapsed menu options. * A status bar
at the very bottom indicates "Python extension loading...". * Windows search
bar is visible at the bottom. **Overall Interpretation:** The image likely
depicts a Python development environment set up in VS Code, using Docker for
containerization. The user is working on a project with Python scripts, Docker
configuration files, and a virtual environment for managing dependencies. The
"Python extension loading..." message indicates that VS Code is still
initializing the Python support. ]image2160×3840 1.92

Yeah, it’s there on your local machine, but you didn’t copy it to docker
container.  
Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only
copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker
container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error.

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-03-29T07:34:25.276Z)

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Composition:** The image is a meme-style photo with text overlaid on a photo
of a large stadium that appears to be under construction or renovation. The
joke relates to software development. **Text:** * **Top:** "WHEN YOU CANNOT
REFACTOR THE CODE" - This is in white text with a black outline, positioned at
the top of the image. * **Bottom:** "BECAUSE OF A TIGHT DEADLINE" - This text
is also in white with a black outline and is placed at the bottom of the
image. **Visual Details:** * **Stadium:** The main subject is a very large
stadium. Some features are visible, but not fully detailed because of the
construction. The visible features include: * A circular roof structure with
an opening in the middle. * A green sports field (likely for soccer or
football) inside the stadium. * Rows of stadium seating that appear to be
mostly red. * **Construction/Renovation:** A large section of the stadium's
seating area has an elaborate scaffolding structure. The scaffolding is
extensive and covers a large portion of one side of the stadium. The seating
area covered by scaffolding appears to be newly built or being replaced, with
a bright red roof. * **Background:** A city skyline is visible in the
background, suggesting the stadium is located in an urban area. There are many
tall buildings. **Interpretation:** The meme uses the image of a stadium that
appears structurally unsound (because of the excessive scaffolding). This is
analogous to messy, poorly-designed code that is built quickly because of a
deadline, rather than taking the time to "refactor" (improve and clean up the
code). The humor lies in the implied analogy that not refactoring can lead to
a structurally unsound product, like the stadium appears.]image474×474 41.7

We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we
mentioned in live sessions.

Line number 81 of your app.py

`subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args,
check=True)`

which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects
data directory to be in root directory.

### Khushi Shah (2025-03-29T07:56:48.878Z)

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS
Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.

I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1
score mail that was released yesterday.

These are the detailed point wise concerns :

  1. I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.

  2. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.

  3. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.

  4. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.

I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a
student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student
had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.

Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or
ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written,
whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the
project with little knowledge.

I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.

Thanks and Regards

One issue file is my app is listening on port 8000. But evaluations being done
on 8219 port. so how it will succeed. Please guide what to do.


---
### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-03-29T09:09:48.134Z)

That’s external port mapping, we mapped your docker’s port 8000 to external
8219 port, so it won’t create issues.

Just look at docker_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it
was for evaluating multiple images parallely.

There is a mistake in the url I guess check this out I have a fully functional
image which was pushed 1 month ago  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image depicts a web interface, specifically a section
within a Docker registry or a similar container image repository management
tool. It appears to be focused on the image management area. **Header
Information:** * **Repository Name:** At the top left, the repository is
identified as "pscodes24/dataworks-agent". * **Repository Stats:** Below the
name, it indicates that the image was last pushed "about 1 month ago" and the
repository size is "490.1 MB". * **Description/Category:** There are options
to "Add a description" and "Add a category," both indicated by edit icons.
**Navigation Tabs:** A horizontal navigation bar presents these tabs: *
General * Tags * Image Management (Currently active and marked with "BETA") *
Collaborators * Webhooks * Settings **Image Filtering/Search:** * **Search
Bar:** There's a search input field labeled "Search by tag (tag:abc...) or
digest (sha256:abc...)". * **Filter Dropdown:** A dropdown labeled "Filter by"
allows further filtering. * **Help/Reporting:** Links like "Where to start?"
and "Report an issue" are present. **Image List (Table):** A table displays a
list of images with the following columns: * **Digest:** Unique SHA256 hash
identifier for each image layer. * **Tags:** Tags associated with the images
(e.g., "latest" for one image). * **Media type:** Currently set to "Image" for
all the displayed images. * **OS/ARCH:** "linux/amd64" is the listed operating
system and architecture. * **Size:** The size of each image layer (273.5 MB

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a
single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path_given”). I feel really
bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and
formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full
responsibility for it.

I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it
reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error
and will be more careful in the Project 2

"image")

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall:** The
image appears to be a console output or log snippet, indicating an error
during a process involving file access and communication with a web service.
**Key Text elements:** * **Error Message:** `"error": "unable to open database
file"` - This suggests a general problem with accessing a database file. *
**HTTP GET Request:** `HTTP Request: GET
http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND"` - This
indicates an attempt to retrieve a file named "b10.csv" from the "/data"
directory on the localhost server (port 8000) using a GET request. The "404
NOT FOUND" status code suggests the file was not found at the specified path.
* **File Read Failure:** `B10 failed: Cannot read /data/b10.csv` - This
reinforces that the program was unable to read the "b10.csv" file. * **Overall
Failure:** `X B10 FAILED` - This shows that the entire process related to
'B10' has failed. * **Score:** `Score: 12 / 20` - This represents a
performance metric. * **HTTP POST Request:** `HTTP Request: POST
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"` -
This shows a successful POST request to an OpenAI embeddings endpoint.
**Interpretation:** The image suggests a scenario where: 1\. The program
encountered a general error opening a database file. 2\. There was an attempt
to read the "b10.csv" file locally. 3\. This attempt failed, resulting in a
404 error and overall failure of the B10 process. 4\. An embedding was
successfully created via an OpenAI endpoint. 5\. There is a performance metric
in the log, indicating a score of 12 out of 20. ]image1094×256 9.59

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
My docker logs shows that `OSError: Cannot find resource` error occurred when
the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.  

[[Image description: The image shows a traceback error in a Python program,
specifically related to opening font resources. Here's a breakdown: *
**"Installed 3 packages in 42ms"**: Indicates that some packages were
installed successfully. * **Traceback (most recent call last):**: Marks the
beginning of the error log. * **File "/tmp/datagenmrt9km.py", line 220, in
a8\\_credit\\_card\\_image**: Shows that the error occurred within a function
named `a8_credit_card_image` in the file `/tmp/datagenmrt9km.py`, specifically
on line 220. * **large\\_font = ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", size=60)**:
This line attempts to load the "arial.ttf" font. * **File
"/root/.cache/uv/environments-v2/ffad51b5c0487eb6/lib/python3.13/site-
packages/PIL/ImageFont.py", line 879, in truetype ... return freetype(font)**:
Indicates the error stems from the Pillow (PIL) library's `ImageFont` module.
The error seems to be in the `truetype` function, which is used to load
TrueType fonts. The call stack shows it's going through `freetype` and
`FreeTypeFont`. * **OSError: cannot open resource**: This is the core error
message, indicating that the program failed to open the specified font file.
This means the program is unable to access or locate the font file
"arial.ttf". * **"During handling of the above exception, another exception
occurred:"**: This indicates that while trying to handle the first error,
another error occurred, indicating the issue might be at a higher level. * The
second traceback is similar but attempts to load the font
"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf". This implies the code is
trying alternative font loading paths. * **INFO: 172.17.0.1:35176 - "POST
/run?
task=%0AInstall+%60uv%60+%28if+required%29+and+run+the+script+%60https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Fsanand0%2Ff19b6797f82b36da39ac4"**:
This line likely indicates that the code was executed via a POST request to a
server. The `task` parameter suggests the program is trying to install `uv` if
required and then execute a script from a GitHub Gist. In summary, the program
is trying to generate or process an image of a credit card, and it's failing
because it can't load the necessary font file (either Arial or DejaVu Sans).
This could be because the font file is missing, inaccessible due to
permissions, or the path to the font file is incorrect. The fact that this
happened for two different font paths suggests a more systemic issue with font
loading or access. ]image1485×807 37.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-
cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/f/dfc4c289dcc2ddda315bd9f97a9ff21c166792af.png
"image")

The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it
encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow
default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled.
Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as
well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did
not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can
you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls
in their own try-except blocks?  

[[Image description: The image displays a list of function names, likely from
a programming context. The function names are: * `a2_format_markdown()` *
`a3_dates()` * `a4_contacts()` * `a5_logs()` * `a6_docs()` * `a7_email()` *
`a8_credit_card_image()` * `a9_comments()` * `a10_ticket_sales()` Each
function name is prefixed with "a" followed by a number (2 through 10), and
separated by an underscore. The function names themselves are descriptive,
suggesting the purpose of each function: to handle markdown formatting, dates,
contacts, logs, documents, email, credit card images, comments, and ticket
sales, respectively. The consistent naming convention indicates a structured
and potentially well-organized code base. The presence of parentheses `()` at
the end of each name identifies them as function names in a programming
language like Python. The black background further reinforces the context of
code or a terminal display. ]image302×252 3.45 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

"image")

  
I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their
own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent
in yesterday’s results mail.

So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9
and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due
to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .

Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font
not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could
be caused by my code.

Thank you

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content: The
image shows a log output from a program or system. It indicates a running task
and encountered errors during execution. **Key Elements:** 1\. **Running Task
(Yellow Highlight):** * The log begins with a description of the task being
executed: "Install `uv` (if required) and run the script
`https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/f19b6797f82b36da39ac44f3a7d4392a/raw/13246698088795e1942179856aafd466052b66ae/datagen.py`
with `23f3003196@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` as the only argument". * This indicates
that the system attempts to install a utility named `uv` if it's not already
present. Then, the script specified by the URL (hosted on
`gist.githubusercontent.com`) should be executed. The script (`datagen.py`)
gets an email address (`23f3003196@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`) as its command-line
argument. 2\. **HTTP Request:** * An HTTP POST request is made to
`http://localhost:8503/run`. * The `task` parameter in the request is a URL-
encoded string representation of the previously described task. It essentially
includes the installation of `uv` (if required), running the `datagen.py`
script from the GitHub gist, and passing the specified email address as an
argument. * The HTTP request returned an error "HTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER
ERROR". 3\. **HTTP 500 Error (Red Highlight):** * An HTTP 500 error response
is received. * The error message is in JSON format: ```json { "error": "Agent
error: 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url:
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions" } ``` * The
error indicates a "429 Client Error: Too Many Requests." This means the system
made too many requests to the URL
`https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions` and is being
rate-limited. It likely interacted with the OpenAI API. **In Summary:** The
image indicates an error encountered during a process involving running a
Python script. The system attempted to use a script from GitHub, which then
made requests to an OpenAI endpoint, but it was rate-limited, resulting in an
"Too Many Requests" error. The root cause seems to be an excessive number of
requests to the OpenAI API. ]image1505×276 16.1 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

this is a 429 from sanand which is an error from your side. The evaluation
already so delayed now has such issues because of which I am getting 1/20.

This is what you submitted to us in the gform.

23f3003027@ds.study.iitm.ac.in mishkat02/automation-agent:latest

We will only evaluate this image.

Kind regards

### Mishkat Chougule (2025-03-29T15:11:48.786Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton) then why is the image id different?

in the docker hub as well as my local terminal the image id is 07b16dc68225


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-29T15:20:02.379Z)

When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes
sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your
submission in the form.

In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer
match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating
the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.

But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope
that is clear.

We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are
any issues. But thanks for asking the question.

Kind regards

### Santosh Sharma (2025-03-30T05:06:28.932Z)

Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of
the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between
`pandas` and `numpy` caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same
versions (`pandas==2.0.3` and `numpy==1.24.3`) were working fine while
developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on
both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning
correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after
pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it
worked at that time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these
versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The
application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected
responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (`santoshsharma003/tds-project-
one-1:latest`). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is
pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time
and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!

### RAJ K BOOPATHI (2025-03-30T10:31:12.160Z)

Hi,

For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution
logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to
verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three
tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.

For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the
task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write
something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access
denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description
itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK

    
    
    ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
    INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    
    

Similarly for task B2.

    
    
    INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md
    ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md
    INFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - "POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    

For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it
not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.

For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in
evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed
properly?  
Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string
formatting” for Task B8

### Jayaram (2025-03-30T17:22:14.882Z)

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not
starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening
because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build

    
    
    ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
     ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
    
    ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
     ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}
    

This was required as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was
required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..

So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in
orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm
altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues..

Checkin url: [Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-
Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub](https://github.com/rsjay1976/TDS-
Project1-Jan25/commit/a71e3a84b284d7621f2a769308340454ebd58583)

Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker
hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the
image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for
reevaluation… Appreciate your help

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into
my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe_open function that
will throw a HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that
directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be
environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally,
it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20.
Is it possible to change/modify my code?

Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for
this

Dear sir, [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
I got result as fail for the project 1 and the reasons listed are as in the
screenshot. But as you can see in the second screenshot, i still have that
repository which is public, have license file and docker file in it, created 2
months back. I actually don’t know how this issues come in, please resolve
this.  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout and Content:** The image shows a screenshot of text related
to project requirements and evaluations. It appears to be a feedback or
evaluation document for a project, likely related to software development. The
title refers to "TDS Project 1." **Key Sections and Text:** 1\. **Project
Requirements:** * Begins with "Project 1 requires you to pass some pre-
requisite checks as detailed on the TDS Project 1: Evaluation page." * Lists
five specific requirements for the project: * Github repository exists and is
publicly accessible. * Github repository has a LICENSE file with the MIT
license. * Github repository has a valid Dockerfile. * Docker image is
publicly accessible and runs via podman (with a specific command). * Docker
image uses the same Dockerfile as in the Github repository. * States that
failure to meet these requirements will result in the submission not being
evaluated. 2\. **Project Prerequisite Evaluations:** * Introduces a section of
evaluations with the heading "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite
evaluations." * Presents a series of evaluation checks with results: * "Is
Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS" * "Is Github repo
present AND public: FAIL" * "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo:
FAIL" * "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL" 3\. **Summary
and Score:** * States "Prerequisites: FAIL" indicating an overall failure
status. * Displays "Project 1 Score: 0", reflecting a zero score due to failed
prerequisites. ]1885×378 56.1 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image shows a screenshot of a GitHub repository page.
The theme is dark. **Top Section (Repository Information):** * **Repository
Name:** "tds_proj1" (indicated as public) * **Branch Information:** Shows
"main" branch selected, with "1 Branch" and "0 Tags". * **Search Bar:** A "Go
to file" search bar with a magnifying glass icon. * **Buttons:** "Add file"
button and a green "<> Code" button with a dropdown arrow. * **Pin and
Unwatch:** Pin and Unwatch icons. **Middle Section (File Listing):** This
section displays the files and directories in the repository's root directory:
* **Commit Information:** A line shows "21f2000304 update", "5e4785c - 2
months ago", and "10 Commits". * **Directory Listing:** A list of file and
directory names along with corresponding commit messages and "2 months ago" as
time of last commit. **File and Directory List:** Here's the list of files and
directories and their associated commit messages: * `_pycache_` (directory):
"update" * `data` (directory): "update" * `env` (directory): "update" *
`Dockerfile` (file): "update" * `LICENSE` (file): "Create LICENSE" * `app.py`
(file): "update" * `datagen.py` (file): "update" * `evaluate.py` (file):
"update" * `requirements.txt` (file): "update" * `tasksA.py` (file): "update"
**General Observations:** * The project appears to be a Python project, given
the presence of `.py` files and `requirements.txt`. * The repeated commit
message "update" suggests possibly frequent updates to multiple files. * The
presence of `Dockerfile` indicates the project may be containerized (likely
with Docker). * The folders `data` and `env` suggest data files and
environment variables respectively. In conclusion, the image shows a GitHub
repository for a Python project called "tds_proj1" with a Dockerfile, and
multiple .py files. The repository has a LICENSE file. ]2908×579 59.8

I have submitted my Project 1, and my GitHub repository meets all the listed
requirements. However, I received a FAIL for the check:

“Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo?”

Despite this, my dockerfile is present in the root directory of my repository.

My evaluation.log  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content, based
on the provided text and observations: **Overall Context:** The image appears
to be a screenshot of a terminal or console output, likely from a debugging or
testing environment. The content shows HTTP requests and responses, along with
error messages, indicating problems during a data processing task. **Key
Elements and Their Description:** 1\. **Header:** *
"23f1002398@ds.study.iitm.a..." This is likely an email address, potentially
identifying the user or the system running the task. 2\. **HTTP Requests and
Responses:** * A series of HTTP requests and their corresponding responses are
displayed. These requests seem to be interacting with a local server
(localhost) on different ports (8309, 8001). * `HTTP Request: GET
http://localhost:8309/read?path=/data/b9.html "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"`:
Indicates a request to read a file (`/data/b9.html`) from the server, which
resulted in a "404 Not Found" error, meaning the file was not found. * `HTTP
Request: POST http://localhost:8309/run?task...`: Indicates a request to run a
task on the server. The task is described in the URL parameters, involving
running datasette with a database. * `"HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"`: The
previous POST request to run the task returned a "400 Bad Request" error,
meaning the server couldn't understand the request due to some issue in the
request's format or content. * `HTTP 400 { ... }`: Further details about the
"400 Bad Request" error. Specifically, there's a `HTTPConnectionPool` error,
indicating a failure to connect to `localhost:8001`. The error "Connection
refused" is reported. * `HTTP Request: GET
http://localhost:8309/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"`: A
similar GET request to read `/data/b10.csv` also results in a "404 Not Found"
error. * `HTTP Request: POST
https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`:
Shows a successful POST request to an external OpenAI endpoint. 3\. **Error
Messages:** * `B9 failed: Cannot read /data/b9.html` * `B10 failed: Cannot
read /data/b10.csv` * `Connection refused`: Suggests that the server at
`localhost:8001` is not running or is not accepting connections. 4\. **Task
Description:** * "Running task: Run datasette via 'uvx datasette /data/ticket-
sales.db --port 8001' in the background." * "From 'tickets' count the number
of rows where type is "Bronze" using http://localhost:8001/ticket-
sales.csv?sql=SELECT+COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type+=%22Bronze%22 and save
it to /data/b10.csv. Then stop the datasette server." * This outlines a task
that involves: * Running a datasette instance. * Using the `ticket-sales.db`
database. * Querying the database to count rows where the `type` is "Bronze".
* Saving the result to `/data/b10.csv`. 5\. **Other Elements:** * "X B9
FAILED" and "X B10 FAILED": Indicates that the data processing steps related
to `b9` and `b10` have failed. * "Score: 6 / 20": A scoring system likely
related to the automated testing or evaluation of the task. **Interpretation
and Potential Issues:** Based on the image, the following issues are apparent:
* **Connection Problems:** The connection to `localhost:8001` is being
refused. This is a major issue, preventing the database query from executing.
This could be because datasette either failed to start or because the server
isn't up and running. * **File Not Found Errors:** The server is not finding
`/data/b9.html` and `/data/b10.csv`. This could be due to incorrect paths, the
files not being created or being deleted unexpectedly, or the server not
having access to the directories. * **"Bad Request" Error:** The POST request
to run the task initially failed with a 400 error. This points to potential
issues with the URL encoding, parameters, or formatting of the request. **In
Summary:** The image shows a debugging log indicating failures in running a
data processing task involving a local database. The primary issue seems to be
the inability to connect to the database server, followed by file access
problems. The initial "Bad Request" also indicates an issue with how the task
execution was initiated. ]IMG_64181290×2619 566 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on
the content and elements visible in it: **Overall Impression:** The image is a
screenshot of an email, likely viewed on a smartphone. The email is addressed
to "Dear Learner" and contains information about a project called "Project 1."
It details the prerequisites for the project and the results of some automated
checks performed on the user's submission. **Textual Content:** *
**Subject/Context:** The email is about "Project 1" and its prerequisites. *
**Prerequisites:** The email lists five mandatory requirements: 1\. The GitHub
repository must exist and be publicly accessible. 2\. The GitHub repository
must have a LICENSE file with the MIT license. 3\. The GitHub repository must
have a valid Dockerfile. 4\. The Docker image must be publicly accessible and
runnable via a `podman run` command (with a specified environment variable and
port mapping). 5\. The Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as in the
GitHub repository. * **Evaluation Results:** The email shows the results of
automated checks for the prerequisites. Specifically, it states: * "Is Docker
image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS" * "Is Github repo present AND
public: PASS" * "Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL" * "Is MIT
license present at root of github repo: PASS" * **Overall Status:** *
"Prerequisites: FAIL" indicating that not all requirements were met. *
"Project 1 Score: 0" **Visual Elements:** * **Email Header:** The email is
shown in an email client interface, likely on a mobile device. * **Email
Footer:** Email Footer showing 99+ unread inbox notification and 8 unread
group notification. **Key Takeaways:** The image indicates that the user's
submission for "Project 1" failed the prerequisite checks due to the absence
of a Dockerfile in the root of their GitHub repository. Consequently, the
project's score is 0. The email instructs the user to ensure they meet all
listed requirements for their submission to be evaluated.]IMG_64171290×2796

Your dockerfile is misspelt.

### Sirimilla Karthik Balaji (2025-03-31T21:01:01.155Z)

Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my
dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so
it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.

However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and
specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the
issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.

Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else
sir.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-31T21:01:54.794Z)

The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it
on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless
you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag
we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.

But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image,
our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will
change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts
as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same
image.

Kind regards

I recently received an email stating that my Docker image is not publicly
available, resulting in a failed prerequisite check for the TDS Project 1.
However, I have ensured that my Docker image is publicly accessible. Please
help.

I have submitted my Project 1, and my GitHub repository meets all the listed
requirements. However, I received a FAIL for the check:

“Is Dockerfile present in root of GitHub repo?”

Despite this, my dockerfile is present in the root directory of my repository.

Github repo link: [GitHub -
Vansh-22f300/project_tds](https://github.com/Vansh-22f300/project_tds.git)

My evaluation.log , contains the score .  
Roll no : 22f3001851  
Mail id:22f3001851@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image's content: **General
Layout:** * The image is a screenshot from a mobile phone (Android) displaying
a GitHub repository. * The repository has a dark theme. **Top Section:** *
**Status Bar:** The top bar shows the time (9:11), battery status, and network
information. * **Repository Info:** * "MIT license" is mentioned, indicating
the licensing for the code. * "0 stars", "0 forks", "1 watching", "1 Branch"
indicate the engagement metrics of the repository. * "0 Tags" and "Activity"
suggest navigational elements or options within the GitHub interface. *
"Public repository" confirms the accessibility status. **Middle Section:** *
**Branch Selection:** A dropdown menu is present labeled "main", implying this
is the currently viewed branch. * **Code Button:** A green "Code" button
indicates options to download or interact with the repository's code. *
**Repository Owner:** "Vansh-22f300" is the username of the repository owner.
**File Listing:** * A list of files and folders within the repository is
displayed. Each item shows the file/folder name and indicates a modification
date of "2 months ago". * **Folders:** "\\_\\_pycache\\_\\_" (likely a Python
cache folder) * **Files:** * ".env" (environment variables file) *
".gitignore" (specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore)
* "LICENSE" (the license file) * "README.md" (a markdown file for repository
documentation) * "app.py", "datagen.py", "evaluate.py", "tasksA.py",
"tasksB.py" (Python scripts/modules) * "dockerfile" (instructions for building
a Docker image) * "requirements.txt" (lists Python package dependencies)
**Bottom Section:** * **Navigation Bar:** The bottom navigation bar of an
Android device is visible, with icons for back, home, and recent apps.
**Overall Impression:** The image shows a developer's GitHub repository,
likely a small Python project, with standard configuration files and several
Python code files. The project seems to be recently updated (2 months ago).

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on
relevant text and features: **Overall Content:** The image appears to be a
screenshot of a mobile phone screen displaying text output, likely from a
terminal or code editor window. The text relates to instructions or a guide
for interacting with a Datasette server and a SQL database. **Key Text
Segments and Their Meanings:** * **"starting the server...\n\n## Step 2: Count
Rows with SQL\n\n1."**: Indicates this is part of a step-by-step guide,
specifically the second step which involves counting rows in a SQL database. *
**"curl or a web browser to make a request to the URL that runs the SQL
query."**: Explains how to interact with the database server by making a
request to a URL. * **`"http://localhost:8001/ticket-sales.csv?sql=SELECT
COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type=%22Bronze%22"`**: This is the key URL that
contains the SQL query being executed. * **"-o /data/b10.csv"**: Indicates
that the output (resulting CSV data) will be saved to a file named "b10.csv"
within the `/data` directory. * **"## Step 3: Stop the Datasette Server"**:
Starts the next step in the guide, detailing how to stop the server. * **"kill
$(jobs -p)"**: A command to kill background jobs running in the terminal
session. * **"bash\nuvx datasette /data/ticket-sales.db --port 8001 &"**:
Starts the Datasette database * **"Additional Notes"**: Suggests that the
following text contains important reminders or requirements. * **"uvx and
datasette are installed"**: Highlights a dependency requirement for the
commands to work. * **"'/data' directory is writable"**: Points out a
permission requirement to avoid errors when writing to the `b10.csv` file. *
**"HTTP Request: GET http://localhost:8064/read?path=/data/b10.csv "HTTP/1.1
404 Not Found""**: This is an error message. It indicates that a request was
made to read the file `/data/b10.csv` but the server couldn't find it, giving
a 404 error. The port is also different, 8064 instead of 8001 * **"B10 failed:
Cannot read /data/b10.csv"**: A more explicit error message stating the same
problem. * **"B10 FAILED"**: Re-emphasizes the error. * **"Score: 10 / 20"**:
Shows a score, likely from an automated test or assignment. * **"HTTP Request:
POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings "HTTP/1.1 200
OK""**: Shows a successful API request to OpenAI **Relevant Features:** *
**Error Messages:** The "404 Not Found" and "B10 failed" messages are
important indicators that something went wrong during the execution of the
provided instructions. * **Directory Path:** The `/data` directory is
significant because it's the location where the output file is supposed to be
created and accessed. * **SQL query:** The SQL query `SELECT
COUNT(*)+FROM+tickets+WHERE+type=%22Bronze%22` specifies what data is being
retrieved from the database. **In summary, the image shows instructions for
running a SQL query against a Datasette server, writing the output to a file,
and then encountering an error when trying to read that file. The error
suggests the file was not successfully created or is not accessible at the
expected path.**

evaluations: * **"These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:"** This
is an introductory statement indicating the purpose of the information. *
**"Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: FAIL"**: This line
indicates that the Docker image was either not found in Docker Hub or was not

Dockerfile exists in the root of the github repository * **"Is MIT license

exists in the root of the github repository * **"Prerequisites: FAIL"**:
Because one of the prerequisites failed (Docker image), the overall
prerequisite status is "FAIL." * **"Project 1 Score: 0"**: Due to the failed
prerequisites, the project score is currently zero. In summary, the image
displays that the project has met some prerequisites (GitHub repo and MIT
license), but the failure to have a public Docker image on Docker Hub has
resulted in an overall "FAIL" status and a score of 0.]image619×241 5.07

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall
Layout:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a web interface, likely from
a container registry or repository management platform (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS
ECR, etc.). It's displaying information about a specific repository.
**Header:** * **Repository Name:** "23f2004644/data\\_automation\\_agent" -
This is the full name or path identifying the repository. * **Last Pushed:**
"Last pushed about 1 month ago" - Indicates the last time an image was pushed
or updated to the repository. * **Repository Size:** "Repository size: 757 MB"
- Shows the total storage space occupied by the repository's images and
associated data. **Action Items:** * "Add a description" - A link/button to
add a description to the repository. * "Add a category" - A link/button to
categorize the repository. * Information Icons (i) appear next to both action
items. **Navigation Tabs:** A set of tabs for managing different aspects of
the repository: * "General" (selected/highlighted) * "Tags" * "Image
Management" (labeled with "BETA") * "Collaborators" * "Webhooks" * "Settings"
**Tags Section:** This section shows information related to the tags within
the repository. * **Headline:** "Tags" * **Summary:** "This repository
contains 1 tag(s)." * **Table with Tag Information:** * **Columns:** "Tag",
"OS", "Type", "Pulled", "Pushed" * **Row 1:** * "Tag": "latest" (with a green
indicator) * "OS": Linux icon * "Type": "Image" * "Pulled": "5 days" (ago) *
"Pushed": "about 1 month" (ago) * "See all" - A link that probably leads to a
comprehensive list of tags. **Key Observations and Interpretations:** * The
repository "23f2004644/data\\_automation\\_agent" has only one tag currently,
which is "latest". * The "latest" tag points to an image built for a Linux OS.
* The image tagged with "latest" was last pushed to the repository about a
month ago. * The image tagged with "latest" was pulled (downloaded) from the
repository 5 days ago. * The interface is in the "Tags" section, where
information about tags (versions) of the images in the repository is displayed
and managed. In short, the image provides a snapshot of the repository's tag
information, showing its current state and some usage statistics.

Respected Sir,

I have received a **FAIL** status for the prerequisite check:  
_“Is Docker image present in Docker Hub AND is public.”_

However, as shown in my Docker Hub repository, my Docker images are publicly
accessible.

I have attached a screenshot for the reference.

Thank you for your time and support.

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Layout:** The image shows a user interface, likely from a web application

Sir, I have the image in the docker and it is upload last month and it is
public. So why have I received a message saying that the image is not
available in the hub. Can you confirm and reevaluate the error.

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal) ,

The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different
than what your screenshot shows. `/jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3` docker repo
doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you.

Dear instructors, I received the mail today regarding project 1 TDS scores and
I have been marked fail because the MIT license is not present. But as can be
seen in the screenshot below the MIT license file is present in my GitHub

It depends where you tested it running, if it’s running inside a docker
container and you feel there is problem with our script then you can debug our
code and create a pull request on repo.

Hi [@24ds2000125](/u/24ds2000125)

You didn’t meet the standard naming convention for mit license naming. Name
should be LICENSE(all caps) or LICENSE.md.  
check this out.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-01T10:06:03.718Z)

The task B6 was  
<https://quotes.toscrape.com/> has quotes from famous people.  
The .author class has the quote author’s name.  
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json
as an array of strings.  
E.g. `["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]`

The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.

Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as
an array of authors.

These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.

Kind regards

### RAJ K BOOPATHI (2025-04-01T10:15:47.725Z)

Hi Course Team,

I have also received an email today saying that my Project1 failed. But few
days back I received an email with evaluation log saying I got 8/20. Which one
is true?

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Content:** The image is a screenshot of an email. The email appears
to be an automated message regarding a project assessment, specifically
Project 1, from an organization called "TDS Team." The email informs the
recipient ("Dear Learner") about prerequisite checks for the project and their
corresponding evaluation results. **Text Breakdown:** * **Header:** "TDS Jan
25 Project 1 Scores Inbox" - Indicates the subject of the email, suggesting it
pertains to project scores and the date. * **Sender Information:** "22t1
se2002 1:24 am to me" - Shows the sender's email address and the time the
email was sent, as well as that it was sent to the viewer of the image. *
**Body:** * "Dear Learner," - Standard email salutation. * The email explains
the project has some pre-requisite checks explained in the "TDS Project 1:
Evaluation page". The email then lists five requirements for the project: *
GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible. * GitHub repository has a
LICENSE file with the MIT license. * GitHub repository has a valid Dockerfile.
* Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via a `podman run` command with
specified parameters. * Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in the GitHub
repository. * It states that failure to meet these requirements will result in
the submission not being evaluated. * "These are your Project 1 Prerequisite
evaluations:" - Introduces the evaluation results. * The email contains the
results of the pre-requisite evaluation: * "Is Docker image present in
dockerhub AND is public: PASS" * "Is Github repo present AND public: PASS" *
"Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL" * "Is MIT license present
at root of github repo: PASS" * "Prerequisites: FAIL" - Indicates that
overall, the prerequisites were not met. * "Project 1 Score: 0" - States the
resulting score for the project. * "Kind regards, TDS Team" - Standard email
closing with the sender's name/team. **Key Features & Objects:** * **Email
interface:** Evident from the formatting, reply and options button, and
general layout. * **"Inbox" tag:** Confirms the email is being viewed within
an email inbox. * **Pass/Fail results:** Clearly displayed after each
requirement, indicating the status of each prerequisite. In summary, the image
showcases an automated email providing feedback on a student's project
submission based on pre-requisite checks. The email details the requirements,
reveals the results of each check, and provides the final score for the
project. ]10001125081080×1716 242 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) My P1 submission successfully
passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a
satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th.
However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker
image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course
team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for
students encountering similar issues.

This situation is particularly disheartening—**seeing days of effort and
dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already
demanding pace of the course.**

I will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Sir,

The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail
that said that it was absent.

Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

Can you also clarify my issue?

My submission meets all the prerequisites according to my Git repository and
Docker image. Additionally, I can see the results in the evaluation log.

Standard name of dockerfile is Dockerfile that’s why it didn’t pass Dockerfile
check

### Sirimilla Karthik Balaji (2025-04-01T18:24:32.092Z)

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
I understand sir Dockerfile name was misspelt sir. Since my Docker image was
built and recognized, I didn’t realize this would prevent evaluation.  
I worked hard on this project sir, and my Docker image was built successfully.
Please consider my submission sir.

### Ansh (2025-04-01T18:24:46.558Z)

I have been trying to resolve all the errors but just noticed that my docker
image id associated with the project is “c9dc7fbcf405” , meanwhile the mail I
received mentions that some other image id was evaluated.  
Can you please look into this matter and evaluate the correct Image ID.

### Shreyan Chaubey (2025-04-01T19:02:11.386Z)

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Carlton](/u/carlton) I completely understand that
changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.

_**However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission
successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score
when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.**_

[[Image could not be described]image1272×395 25.7
KB](https://europe1.discourse-
cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/a/9acc2fc47ea84b9e26c1ed21442ba873d0dca20e.png
"image")

But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project
2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and
use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:*

  * Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629).
  * Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.
  * Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.
  * Adding useful API endpoints, including an **`/api/`** multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing **`/read`** and **`/run`** endpoints from Project 1, plus a **`/clear`** endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.
  * **Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP** , utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.

All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-
Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using
Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a
container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something
like **hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the
results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents** , and it would do
that for you—without **ever** declining the request. I like to think of it as
a **terminal version of** [OpenAI’s Computer-Using
Agent](https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/).

* * *

Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly
discouraging to see my project **naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image
digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)** and not get evaluated as
a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to
learn, experiment, and innovate.

## To clarify, **all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29** ,
**after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed
out.** Furthermore, we were **never informed** that a reevaluation would take
place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original
submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker
image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.

My only request is that if my **updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated**
due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April
1), I would really appreciate it if my **original P1 eval score could be
reinstated** instead of receiving a **0** —since it was already evaluated and
graded.

Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-02T07:35:26.123Z)

Hi [@thinkmachine](/u/thinkmachine) [@22f3002723](/u/22f3002723)

Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support
timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and
will build through it and run evaluations.

We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to
keep.

This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20
such cases

Hi [@thinkmachine](/u/thinkmachine)  
As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be
accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply
because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would
be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container
and run evaluations on that.

### Shreyan Chaubey (2025-04-02T09:31:53.254Z)

A sigh of relief! Thank you so much for the heads up [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj).

[@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly
understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an
image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the
fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image
differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in
the future.

Once again, thank you both!

I am still uncertain as to why I received a second email regarding my project

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-02T14:18:50.862Z)

Hi [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)

Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for
basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a
looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.

We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all
the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and
2.

We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.

Kind regards

### Vansh Mittal (2025-04-02T14:26:27.322Z)

dockerfile , lower case ‘d’ character instead of upper case.  
Please sir see through it

### LAKSHAY (2025-04-02T14:30:33.339Z)

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton) , for your response.

I was never worried about the result, whether it comes late or early. I know
you will release it once everything is processed correctly. My concern was
only about getting a response. Anyway, thanks for replying.

Also, today’s session has been canceled. I wanted to ask about the issue with
editing responses in the Project 2 form. Is there any update on this?

### Chinnam Goutham Nischay (2025-04-02T18:21:51.820Z)

Hi just wanted to know, there was no mail prior stating to keep the Dockerfile
in the root folder of the repo (correct me if im wrong). Therefore i have put
everything inside a folder - wont this be considered? Please clarify if
possible.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-03T00:30:31.000Z)

You have to show which task triggered this error. Is it all of them or only
one of them. Only then we can diagnose what the problem is.

Here it is with the task, however the error doesn’t seem to be related to the
task itself based on the returned message in the JSON. It seems to be
something wrong with the OpenAI API key. From the reading I did, it seems that
the key was perhaps not set properly during evaluation? Not completely sure
but please look into it.

### Chinnam Goutham Nischay (2025-04-03T06:29:32.803Z)

Please, can you put a screenshot of where it has been communicated, prior to
the deadline.


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-03T06:51:18.604Z)

We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an
email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February
16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.

We discussed it internally with [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) and he stated that it
is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github
and he expects students to do it **regardless of whether we explicitly
mentioned it or not** on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker
image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file
sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is
not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root
is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is
standard industry practise.

In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile
inside the github and it was vetoed by [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our
evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is
effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not
be able to evaluate your docker image.

Kind regards,  
TDS team

### Saini Nirmal (2025-03-31T21:18:59.717Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some
sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only
verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the
accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks
and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all
the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0
Score.

I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the
same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.

Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times.
Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was
later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students
experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera
issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised
similar concerns with Proctor.

Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could
be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my
submission.

checks with an older, stricter script. The newer script passes your
evaluation.

### Chinnam Goutham Nischay (2025-04-03T07:07:07.893Z)

Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter.
Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the
sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for
others.  
if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have
missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.

Hi [@21f2000709](/u/21f2000709)

We have used another approach because of architecture problem, by pulling
through latest commit from github before 18th feb. Just checked we have
results for you.

This was a problem from our side and we rechecked and now we score against
your submission.

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-03T09:57:36.781Z)

If you used openai’s python module then you were needed to pass your own api
key, hardcode it in code.

API key that we were sending was only valid through proxy server created by
professor anand.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-02T16:07:20.865Z)

We are rebuilding all docker submissions from github commit before 18th of
Feb, using your Dockerfile manifest present in the repo.

That way there is no architecture issues.

Its part of our secondary check. And more students have gotten scores in this
check. So dont worry.

I just checked from my side also, wow a very dumb mistake now costing me a

asking.

Am assuming no lenient correction can be done for that? like during the
evaluation …

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-03T11:00:44.378Z)

but in Dockerfile in your github repo you didn’t run main.py,


---
### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-03T11:02:19.716Z)

In your Dockerfile you didn’t copy taskA.py to the container.

In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written
as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many
students.

I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed
it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that
the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?

After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just
to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases
passed.

This is a common mistake many, many students made. They created a working

You only copied `app.py` into your docker image.

How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your
repo clearly shows is needed?

Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-04T06:06:04.491Z)

[@thinkmachine](/u/thinkmachine)

Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient
script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a
more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can
breathe a sigh of relief. :slight_smile:

_However_ with regards to your long post…

Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a _very_ experienced senior
engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom
from him.

What you have done is what is called in industry as **gold plating**. Its a
cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.

In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?

  1. Because it does not deliver what was required,
  2. Wastes valuable time and resources
  3. Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)
  4. Complicates testing
  5. Leads to scope creep

His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.

I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance
and make you stand out.

For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if
you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation
(by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like
an appropriate place to explain this).

Kindest regards

### Abhay Mehra (2025-04-04T08:04:19.957Z)

Hi Sir,  
I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag “abhay227/version1”
instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is **4db729a03f74** ,
which is part of version1 that is already present and publicly available.  
I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this
error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any
notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1
form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you
please consider this correct image ID.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your
positive response.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-04T09:06:11.401Z)

Hi Abhay,

This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to
relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the
minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those
clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we
just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not
be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.

Kind regards

### Shreyan Chaubey (2025-04-04T22:16:43.757Z)

Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, [@carlton](/u/carlton).
It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated.
Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching
the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April
1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.

Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come
to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience,
especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets,
maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS
projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s
possible **within the scope of the problem statement**.

What began as just another (pun intended) _tedious_ assignment slowly evolved
into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents.
:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:

_(…caution: long post ahead :sweat_smile:)_

I noticed that **test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often
overlapping on Python & Shell use**. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode
50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were
doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots
+ hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the
**inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads**. No two payloads are exactly
alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or
some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably.
There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.

Some might suggest using `temperature=0` to get more deterministic LLM
behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage
exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on
environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as
4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when
the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions.
There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.

**Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more
like passive AI powered regex matchers** : merely mapping inputs to functions
by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the
hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning
process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep
calling them like a broken record.

At the core of it, it’s all about **how much flexibility vs rigidity** we give
to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break
easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-
target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would
naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.

Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning,
the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,

  * Reason about the task, understand intent,
  * Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. _design_ a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)
  * Execute those workflows (_walk_ the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.
  * Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.

Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in [this ICLR 2022
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). That was all the validation I needed
to know I was stepping in the right direction.

To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of
narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of **general-purpose tools** :

  * A REPL executor (for quick calcs)
  * A Python script runner
  * A Shell executor

With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding
overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing
for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.

As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of
Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results
etc.) — that was **emergent behavior** , not deliberate gold plating. It was a
pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting
hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes
that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business
relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration
and research. _Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!_

I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)
for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas
that I can tinker with. **Food for thought! Really!**

As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting
with— modalities.

PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a
perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these
projects: **thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design**. At this point, I’m less
concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride.
:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:

* * *

**TL;DR**  
My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes
user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using
general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback
and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the
minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces
together.

Kind regards

Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given – Repository Was Public with All
Required Files

Dear [@Carlton](/u/carlton) sir  
I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my
project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a
bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.

  * My GitHub repository was **public** at the time of submission.
  * I had included the **Dockerfile** as required.
  * I also added the **MIT License** to the project.
  * For your reference, I am also attaching a **snapshot** of the repository as it was during the submission time.

Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could
provide a **concrete reason** for giving **zero marks**. I’m eager to
understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself.
But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and
not having mit licsence .

please just check my repo manually and clarify whether it was public or not .
What is going on this degree .

### HariOm Pandey (2025-04-06T10:25:14.903Z)

### Arun Vembu S (2025-04-06T10:27:58.037Z)

Hi sir  
I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared
on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the
final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B
were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.

During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so
I’m a bit confused about the change.  
Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir  
Thank you

Dear [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir,

I was getting 8 marks in your evaluation but today I checked the mail, I was
awarded 0 marks. I am not sure what happened. Everything was in place. I would
really appreciate if you can provide a reason for zero marks. I rechecked
everything and looks good. Awaiting your reply. Thanks.

Respected sir,  
I have passed all pre-requisites however my file wasn’t evaluated due to port
error (127.0.0.1). Please allow me rectify it as it everything else has passed
and is in accordance to the guidelines and I had worked really hard for it not
to be evaluated only.

### Bingi Sai Mohith (2025-04-06T11:09:50.310Z)

Dear [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir,  
I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran
before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results
shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later,
a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted.
Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing
and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.  
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and
solution in this regard.  
Thank you.

### Santosh Sharma (2025-04-06T11:56:39.048Z)

Respected Sir,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation,
as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.

According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks
with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran
the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A.
Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the
p1_evaluation_error_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any
reference to my roll number.

Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any
guidance from the evaluation team.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

### Kartikay Taunk (2025-04-06T11:57:17.109Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton) i am sure i had cleared 8/10 test cases in part A of
the project despite rigrous checking and no error was found my be but still i
have been alloted 0 in all the cases , this is no small issue as project holds
a significant amount of weightage in the end term  
I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on
par with the desired work i did  
Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this
term or not.

with 8/10 marks but today it is showing 0 marks on my email, but when I run it
just now it is showing 4/10 on my vs code.  
Whereas when I download the file from GitHub and run it, it is showing 1/10
now.

To replicate the test environment:

Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that.
You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication
for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the
appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv.

Pass the required arguments to the above application and it will find the
latest commit before the 18th, fetch it and unzip it to the folder you
specified. Please use the appropriate arguments as specified in the
application.

`docker build -t <your image name> .`

Run new docker image using  
`docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 <your image name>`

Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder  
`uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port
8000`

This then re-produces the exact environment how your application was tested.  
You have to provide a token from your environment for testing.

These instructions are same for everyone. So check first before posting here.

Then post with your queries after testing as mentioned above.  
Also check the evaluation logs first to see why it failed. Address that
question.  
Posting “it ran before submission” is insufficient evidence.  
The whole point of deployability is that it runs anywhere at anytime.  
That is what is being tested, not that it ran on your machine (unless you
replicate the test environment exactly).

Kind regards

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-06T12:47:16.601Z)

Your repo is not public! Thats why we cannot see any other files either. If
its not public we cannot see if other files exist. We cannot evaluate an
invisible repo.

All the files are in this folder (I wasn’t aware that we cannot have the

the datagen and evaluate.py file.

Instead,in order to run the docker image successfully we have to do either of

    Use full path (recommended if you're outside the project folder):
    
    docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1
    

**OR**  
2)

    
    
    Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:
    
    docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 .
    

_Both the things work for me_(:up_arrow:)

Dockerfile has to be inside root of any github repo, this is standard and we
had discussion with Professor Anand about such cases where it’s not part of
root directory, he suggested we will consider only Dockerfile being present in
root folder of the repo.

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t
informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should
allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have
to move files in the repo please consider it)[@carlton](/u/carlton)

### Sanjita Prabhu (2025-04-06T14:16:52.383Z)

Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the
root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not
mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair
to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the
course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of
us were unaware. Please do consider this request.

### RAJ K BOOPATHI (2025-04-06T14:35:49.703Z)

Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to
be only in the root folder.”

If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the
project page?

We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for
whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry
standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end
because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod
push.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Dear Sir,  
I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found.  
I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and
it is  
CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”] has an **invisible Unicode non-
breaking space** (`U+00A0`) between `"run", "app.py"` instead of a regular
space. This causes the shell to misread the command.  
I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake
spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally
get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and
github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my
submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried
my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE. Expecting a
positive response from your end.

### Abhay Mehra (2025-04-06T14:50:49.740Z)

Sir, I realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag

`4db729a03f74`, which is part of version1 and is already present and publicly
available.  
Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any notification about this issue after
submission. Receiving this mail at this stage feels disheartening after all
the effort I’ve put into the project. I kindly request you please consider
this correct image ID.

Could you rerun the test ?


---
### Santosh Sharma (2025-04-06T15:16:52.371Z)

Respected Sir,

Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test
environment.  
Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment  
I cloned my repository using:

    
    
    bash
    git clone <my_repo_url>
    cd <my_repo_directory>
    I built the Docker image using:
    
    bash
    docker build -t.
    I ran the Docker container with:
    
    bash
    docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000
    
    I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.
    
    Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:
    
    bash
    uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000
    

Issue with Original Submission  
After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my
original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas
(version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly
during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across
both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the
submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any
issues locally.

However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to
fail.  
I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and
previously conveyed this in my earlier message.

Action Taken  
To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file
to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments.
This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container
with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test
environment, and it worked as expected:

The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.

It responds to requests within the required timeframe.

I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:  
Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest

Request for Re-Evaluation  
I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from
Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability
is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my
submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup
exactly.

Previous Message for Reference  
For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in
detail:

"Greetings, Sir,

I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of
the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between
pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same
versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing
on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux
and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly
before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the
Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that
time as well.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these
versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The
application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected
responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.

I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-
one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is
pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time
and effort in reviewing my submission again.

Thank you for your assistance!"

There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you
are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because
your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup
mentioned in this post before posting your query?

Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.  
You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you
have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate
the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.

You can take it up with [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
I did not come up with the standard.  
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a
project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration
files.

> Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end
> because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of
the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance.
He made the decision to enforce this protocol.

Respected Sir,  
see the above image its from the scores we got from mail just before the

this possible…  
the link for evaluation in which i got 7/20 is :

MOST importantly mail shows :  
**Your final t score** calculation is based on

MIN (20, (task score + bonus))

**Github repo submitted:** [GitHub -

Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb):

So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have

We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who
passed the pre-requisites.

but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker_logs.zip or

If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no
logs.  
90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo.

The specific error in your case is:  
tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists

Thats why there are no logs.

What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a

incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-06T18:41:59.248Z)

Most common reason for during running docker image was `taskA module was
missing` which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with
building and running image, if they would have done that they could have
corrected it at early stage.

### D HARICHARAN  (2025-04-06T19:06:07.077Z)

Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs
automatically  
when:  
`uv run app.py` is run and for docker image it installs while building and I
had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile
below, in that it installs while building).  
my dockerfile from the repo:

    
    
    FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm
    
    # Install dependencies
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates
    
    # Download and install uv
    ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
    RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh
    
    # Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
    RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow
    
    # Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
    ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"
    
    # Set up the application directory
    WORKDIR /app
    # Copy application files
    COPY *.py /app/
    COPY .env /app/
    
    # Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
    CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]
    

here u can see it installs using pip install …

here it’s requiring `.env` file to be present in the project folder because my
project when I was uploading to both git and docker had `.env` file for
AIPROXY_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that `.env` file but as git
doesn’t allow upload of `.env` file I couldn’t upload`.env` to git

the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload
AIPROXY_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for
replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built
because`.env` file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository
from the above method, it didn’t have the `.env` file so it didn’t build so I
had to create the `.env` file now to create the docker image, and for the
dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the `.env` file(it supports
both`.env` file and environment variable one)

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-06T19:22:42.862Z)

Yes problem was missing `.env` file, Your repo, was supposed to run in a test
environment.

It was named wrongly.  
You named it LICENCE but it should be LICENSE or LICENSE.md.

### D HARICHARAN  (2025-04-06T19:54:37.949Z)

But sir, just because the repository doesn’t have .env file it couldn’t build
the dockerimage, the docker image will build in any test environment as u said
but it requires the .env to be included which the git didn’t have(it doesn’t
allow upload of it ofcourse), don’t rerun the evaluation again but please sir
atleast give me those 7/20 marks along with the pre-requisite bonus(1mark)
that was mailed earlier to me along with logs…this is my primary degree after
12th, I’m also not asking any extra marks just the marks that i got earlier:

Anything after deadline we can’t consider any changes, it was just a matter of
time, you didn’t tests running evaluate.py on docker container that was
created, otherwise you would have spotted this mistake and rectified it.


---
### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-06T22:34:25.989Z)

In your github repo, Dockerfile should be named as Dockerfile(D caps).


---
### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-06T22:39:30.596Z)

I don’t know reason behind it, earlier evaluation was done by pulling docker
image.  
Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not
consistent with docker image it might cause problems.

LLM won’t provide same results every time, for that reason we have give bonus
marks.

### Veer Shah (2025-04-07T01:41:25.976Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir it is my humble request to do
something. We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes
like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already
the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the
correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the
requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork
that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks
and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does
the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects
which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the
subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each
task which my image passes.

### Anisha Seth (2025-04-07T01:49:33.296Z)

hardwork.

### Bharat Choudhary (2025-04-07T02:46:43.961Z)

Sir, how my git repo is not consistent i used the same repo which i have given
you in the form even i did not commit any changes after 18th feb also in my
docker file there is just a simple mistake that i forgot to add flask
dependency just because of that mistake i am losing my marks. I also used same
docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please
consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effort’s.


---
### Afsal (2025-04-07T04:25:33.067Z)

Dear Sir,  
I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly
apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much
effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the
course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the
work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.

Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I
genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of
the commitment I’ve shown so far.

With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project
again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and
would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.

Hi [@23f1001524](/u/23f1001524) [@afsalshah](/u/afsalshah)
[@23f1000879](/u/23f1000879) [@23f1002056](/u/23f1002056)

I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly
meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because
there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were
conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum
standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then
it would make evaluations meaningless.

We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability
as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we
cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise
with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may
only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause
a critical failure.

**A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things
from working.**

**Critical failures prevents everything else from working** and thus most of
these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact
critical failures.

I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be
important going forward in your career.

Kindest regards

### Veer Shah (2025-04-07T09:26:40.790Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand),

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration
regarding the evaluation of my project submission.

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the
repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image
earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the
final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit
confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were
also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into
account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at
least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.

I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical,
and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such
expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many
students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and
demotivation.

I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for
the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an
understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.

I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the
efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern
is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can
significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can
be considered with empathy.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

###  KARTHIK (2025-04-07T09:57:43.886Z)

Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file
as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these
details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a
lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could
kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results
are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to
request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely
learned a lot from it.

I think the mistake would have been because in my repo the file name is

I don’t know how to check for the errors I made, [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir can
you at least show the prerequisite form that I submitted so I can check for
myself ?.

### Sarthak Singh Gaur (2025-04-07T14:22:03.831Z)

[@jivraj](/u/jivraj)

earlier I built the project inside app folder so it was

    
    
    COPY app /app
    

it should have been

    
    
    COPY . /app
    

Is there anything that can be done on your end now?  
All the code is there.

For dockerfile you have in repo, It was named differently, correct naming has
to be Dockerfile.

### K Senthur Kumaran  (2025-04-07T14:51:53.998Z)

Dear [@carlton](/u/carlton)

This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the  
`/app/app/main.py` file is missing. However, in my project directory, the  
`main.py` file is located in the `app/` folder, and the `run.py` file is in
the root folder of the project, which is `LLM_Automation_Agent` . This
structure allows the `run.py` file to run the project without any issues by
calling the appropriate functions from `app/main.py`.

To run the project, the command I used is:

    
    
    python run.py
    

Since `run.py` is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it
should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the
calls to `app/main.py`.

I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not
executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the
project using the `run.py` script located in the root folder (`llm-automation-
agent`).

For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where
the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.

Here is the GitHub link to my project:

This `npx` error is originating from your Docker container—it’s not being
generated by our script. Try to look for what caused this error.

### Mishkat Chougule (2025-04-07T16:23:03.736Z)

My code uses `npx` to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via
`subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...])`, which assumes
that `npx` is available in the environment. However, since the Docker
container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or `npx`,
this results in an error during evaluation.

To test the functionality correctly, `npx` must be installed inside the
running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing
Node.js and npm using:

bash:` apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm`

Once installed, `npx prettier@3.4.2` should work as expected.

For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task
locally on my Windows 11 system, where `npx` is available by default.

### Wasim Ansari (2025-04-07T19:50:31.765Z)

Dear Sirs,  
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that
hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running
smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as
intended.

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content,
focusing on text, objects, and relevant features: **Overall Content:** The
image appears to be a screenshot of instructions, likely for a coding project
or assignment. It's presented in a bulleted list format with a dark
background. The text is in a light color for contrast. **Detailed Breakdown:**
* **Bullet Points:** The image shows a list of bullet points, which indicate
sequential steps or requirements. * **Text Content:** * "Create a Dockerfile
that builds your application" * "Publish your Docker image publicly to Docker
Hub" * "Ensure that running your image via" * `podman run --rm -e
AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME automatically serves the
API at` * `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and
`http://localhost:8000/read?path=...` * "Submit in this Google Form the URL of
your GitHub repository" * `(https://github.com/user-name/repo-name) and your
Docker image name (user-name/repo-name )` * **Code Snippets:** The image
includes code snippets, most notably the `podman run` command with environment
variables, port mapping, and image name parameters. There is also placeholders
for URL’s and names for Github repository and Docker image.
**Interpretation:** Based on the content, the image outlines the following
main steps: 1\. Create a Dockerfile to containerize an application. 2\.
Publish the Docker image to Docker Hub. 3\. Run the Docker image using
`podman` with specific configurations (setting an environment variable,
mapping ports). 4\. Submit the GitHub repository URL and Docker image name in
a Google Form. The `podman` command suggests that the running application will
serve an API at the specified local host addresses. The use of environment
variables (AIPROXY\\_TOKEN) indicates that the application likely requires
authentication or configuration via environment variables. ]Screenshot

"Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513")

**Github repo submitted:** [GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-
Agent](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent)  
**Docker repo submitted:** wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent

The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image,
which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation,
the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the
`app.py` file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing
from the evaluation logs bundle.

I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the
`app.py` file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a
subfolder:  
[https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-
Agent/app/app.py](https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-
Agent/blob/main/app/app.py).  
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only:
<https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent>.

Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the
GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known
this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to
support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly,
and the app responded to all queries as expected.

I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this
issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a
successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully
to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my
case and extend your support in this matter.

Thank You and Regards,

24ds3000090

### Shivaditya Bhattacharya (2025-04-07T20:42:10.131Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating
the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used
in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly
without creating the files for A8 to A10.

[[Image description: The image shows a traceback from a Python program that
failed to open a font file using the Pillow (PIL) library. Specifically, it
looks like it's trying to use two different fonts: "arial.ttf" initially, and
then "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf" after the first attempt
fails. The core error is an OSError: "cannot open resource," indicating that
the program cannot access or find the specified font files. The traceback
reveals the following key points: 1\. **Program:** The failing program is
located at `/tmp/datagen66arSL.py`. 2\. **Error Location:** The initial error
occurs within the `a8_credit_card_image` function, specifically on line 220
when attempting to load "arial.ttf" and later on line 224 when attempting to
load DejaVuSans.ttf. 3\. **Pillow/PIL:** The error originates from within the
Pillow library's `ImageFont.py` module, particularly in the `truetype`,
`freetype`, and `__init__` methods. These methods are responsible for loading
and initializing TrueType fonts. 4\. **Font Paths:** The program is trying to
load the font "arial.ttf" and then, after that fails,
"/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf". 5\. **OS Error:** The root
cause of the failure is an OSError: "cannot open resource", meaning the
program couldn't open or access the font file. This could be due to various
reasons, such as the font file not existing at the specified location,
insufficient permissions to access the file, or a problem with the font file
itself. The traceback suggests that the program attempts to use 'arial.ttf'
first, fails, handles the resulting exception, and then tries to use
'DejaVuSans.ttf'. The same error occurs during the second attempt. This
indicates the issue is likely related to the program's ability to access font
files in general. ]image1298×857 29.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-
cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/4/a49f182e22015df35039be85cdd26ad71a07f7a3.png
"image")

I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my
code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation
currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as
the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not
find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included
in my own code or image somehow.

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python
3.13/site-packages/…  
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an
issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required
python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.

Edit 2:  
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still
should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content,
focusing on text and code structure: **Overall:** The image depicts Python
code, likely a script or program related to data processing or analysis. The
code includes sections for argument parsing, file system operations, and
potentially other tasks through function calls. **Code Breakdown:** 1\. **`if
__name__ == "__main__":`**: This is the standard entry point for Python
scripts, ensuring the code block within it is only executed when the script is
run directly, not when imported as a module. 2\. **`import argparse`**:
Imports the `argparse` module, used for defining and parsing command-line
arguments. 3\. **`parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()`**: Creates an
`ArgumentParser` object, which will handle argument definitions. 4\.
**`parser.add_argument("email")`**: Defines a positional argument named
"email". 5\. **`parser.add_argument("--root", default="/data")`**: Defines an
optional argument named "--root" with a default value of "/data". 6\. **`args
= parser.parse_args()`**: Parses the command-line arguments into an `args`
object. 7\. **`config["email"] = args.email`**: Assigns the value of the
"email" argument to a key named "email" in a `config` dictionary (presumably).
8\. **`config["root"] = os.path.abspath(args.root)`**: Gets the absolute path
of the "root" argument using `os.path.abspath()` and assigns it to a key named
"root" in the `config` dictionary. 9\. **`os.makedirs(config["root"],
exist_ok=True)`**: Creates a directory using `os.makedirs()`. The directory
path is taken from the "root" value in the `config` dictionary.
`exist_ok=True` ensures the function doesn't raise an error if the directory
already exists. 10\. **`print("DISCLAIMER: THIS SCRIPT WILL CHANGE BEFORE THE
EVALUATION. TREAT THIS AS A GUIDE.")`**: Prints a disclaimer message. 11\.
**`print("Files created at", config["root"])`**: Prints the directory path
where files are created, using the "root" value from the `config` dictionary.
12\. **Function Calls:** The following lines show calls to functions, implying
that the script carries out a variety of tasks: * `a2_format_markdown()` *
`a3_dates()` * `a4_contacts()` * `a5_logs()` * `a6_docs()` * `a7_email()` *
`a8_credit_card_image()` * `a9_comments()` * `a10_ticket_sales()` **In
Summary:** The code snippet is a Python script that takes command-line
arguments for email and a root directory. It creates the root directory (if it
doesn't exist) and then calls several functions to perform various operations,
possibly related to processing data, formatting markdown, extracting
information (dates, contacts, logs, documentation), handling email, processing
credit card images, handling comments, and handling ticket sales. The script
has a disclaimer suggesting it is under development or subject to change.

cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f99c9908823f381a7756ba6fe89d4827ca2faf4.png
"image")

  
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of
these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring
independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as
error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal
termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10
as well.

Thank you.  
Regards,  
Shivaditya

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your
repo.  
Therefore it does not build.  
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not
from yours.  
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.

Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.

Kind regards

Your container failed to run after building it.

    
    
    docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: exec: "uv": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown
    

Thats why we cannot evaluate it.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-08T06:29:24.100Z)

There is **clearly** _some difference_ between both the applications. That is
up to you to figure out. I can only tell whats wrong with yours. After
building it and trying to run it this is the error we get. It fails to run as
a result and we cannot evaluate it.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-08T09:37:52.730Z)

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus.
Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not
get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got
rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission
only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a
bonus.

### D HARICHARAN  (2025-04-08T13:24:46.118Z)

Respected Sir,

  * Yes Sir, I said the same, `.env` was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
  * when we download the repository it doesn’t have the `.env` file,
  * for docker image to build we need to add `.env` with `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
  * after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
  * As you said Sir that you will use separate `AIPROXY_TOKEN`…you can put that in `.env` file and build the docker image
  * after that Sir its optional to pass `AIPROXY_TOKEN` again while running the docker Image
  * just the `.env` file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable

and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so
had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker
image in the previous message, the steps which I used:

    
    
    git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git
    

adding `.env` with AIPROXY token and replacing `evaluate.py` and `datagen.py`
with new ones according to test environment

    
    
    docker build -t llm-agent .
    
    
    
    docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
    or
    docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
    

and in another terminal

    
    
    uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000
    

Thank you  
Kind regards

### S Sharmile (2025-04-08T15:08:33.577Z)

Respected sir  
I understand it’s my mistake sir and I apologize for that sir, but please
consider this time sir since because of this my entire project score went from
9/20 to 0, which would make me difficult to pass this course and continue my
diploma.  
Please consider this request sir, sorry sir and this would never be repeated
in future. My project evaluation was 9/20 initially sir, but later it came
down to 0 because of this issue. Kindly consider sir please.

That destroys the purpose of containerization, your container should run

### Jayaram (2025-04-09T06:36:56.097Z)

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had my office
proxy url’s set as http_proxy and https_proxy.. It worked in my office
envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the
results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were
preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.

Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where
docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with
playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are
kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,

Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and
ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..

It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again
appreciate all your help so far.

Sir,  
Regarding the recent feedback on **Project 1** for **TDS** , it was mentioned
that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is
named **`dockerfile`** (not **`Dockerfile`**). Please verify the repository
again with this in mind.

Additionally, my Docker image architecture is _linux/amd64_ (64-bit **x86**).
I have also filled out the **Architecture Information Collector** form as
requested.

**Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)**  
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb):
1  
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb):

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-10T05:31:59.952Z)

Hi Hilal,

You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post

[Image could not be described] [Tds-official-
Project1-discrepencies](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-
official-project1-discrepencies/171141/316) [Tools in Data
Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34)

> To replicate the test environment: Fetch the github repo’s latest commit
> before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli
> installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api
> enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo
> details you can run this code using uv. # /// script # dependencies = [ #
> "requests", # ] # /// import requests import datetime as dt import zoneinfo
> import argparse import os import zipfile parser = argparse.…

That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.

The specific error itself means:  
Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t
find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside
the container.

If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating
the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have
reflected how your dockerised application would work.

Kind regards

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-11T05:58:23.286Z)

Hi Jayaram,

Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo,
regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we
allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes
and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make
corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes.

Kind regards

Thanks for the response [@carlton](/u/carlton) .. just a small suggestion, to
avoid scenarios like what i faced and also with softwares like docker/podman
not being too windows friendly, i think students can find it easier if a
dev/mock linux env is provided for course term duration, instead of everyone
having to figuring out with AWS/Azure and all providers.. Anyway thanks and
appreciate all the help

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Requested sir  
This is to request that in my evaluation a got 0 cause of the use of lowercase
d instead of uppercase D but I have already submitted the docker file in my
git hub repo also.

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Thank you i found my mistake in my docker file i wrote this CMD [“uv”, “run”,
“app.py”] instead of  
CMD [“uvicorn”, “main:app”, “–host”, “0.0.0.0”, “–port”, “8000”].Now i think
everything works fine

### Shivaditya Bhattacharya (2025-04-14T10:10:56.167Z)

Sir any news on this? Did my score increase at all? My dashboard still shows
the old score.


---
### Adarsh kumar (2025-04-14T20:39:18.125Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, my project 1 marks have still not increased even
though while during evaluation it shows 4/10 for the task 1. It was said that
the docker image prerequisite will be removed and without that the evaluation
would be done, but there is still no change in my marks. please look into it
once, as my dashboard currently reflects 0 for project 1.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-15T07:49:58.000Z)

These evals are being handled separately. They have not yet been completed.
Kindly bear with us till they are complete.

### Maulik Dang (2025-04-15T11:06:47.111Z)

Same here [@carlton](/u/carlton) in my evaluation logs i have scored 10 while
marks being reflected are not the same neither on mail nor on site

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-15T11:31:06.090Z)

I looked at your evaluation logs and it says 1 score instead of 10.

Good evening!  
[1000092114|690x198](/uploads/short-url/30ijyIo5UiUUEVvnPZklfYVY2mI.jpeg)

I am writing to you to request you please relook into the evaluation.

The docker image which I share is working at my end. The size of the image is
6 GB which may take more than 5 minutes to load as I wasn’t aware of the infra
level restrictions.

I request you to kindly consider my request and please re-evaluate the
assignment as I have contributed a lot of effort into it.

Thanks,  
Garima

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Sir,  
I am Saksham Umate and my project 1 was to be re-evaluation because of docker
file not found in root ,but it was their so you had given me confirmation that
it will re-evaluate after end term. I had already shared my docker file
systems configuration at docker hub

So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of
efforts to complete it

Tell me if any information is needed about project from my side  
Thank you!

Best regards,  
Saksham

Evaluations are done for such cases where Dockerfile(with name of Dockerfile
as `Dockerfile`) was present inside other folders than root folder of your
github repo.

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-17T07:34:59.259Z)

Hi [@22f3000819](/u/22f3000819)

We had updated datagen.py(try block for task) which affected 30 students, but
scores changed only for 4 students, for others it remained the same.


---
### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-04-17T07:35:35.739Z)

We will be pushing marks today.


---
### Shivaditya Bhattacharya (2025-04-17T07:40:39.300Z)

I probably wasn’t 1 of the 4, right? Anyways thanks for paying attention to
the matter.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Respected Sir,

I hope you are doing well.  
This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-
evaluated after end term  
I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1
submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was
named `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of
the required `Dockerfile` (with an uppercase ‘D’).

While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several
evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the
Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate
from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following
naming conventions precisely.

I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a
one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my
project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at
risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error
will not occur again in the future.  
So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of
efforts to complete it.  
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,  
S. Sharmile  
Roll No: 23f3001688

### Adarsh kumar (2025-04-17T17:03:34.931Z)

Sir, my marks still did not get updated, please help me in that regard.


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-18T03:36:17.392Z)

Hi Everyone,

We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they
are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it
to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed,
we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score.

Thanks & Kind regards


---
### Adarsh kumar (2025-04-18T13:54:05.934Z)

Sir, my project 1 marks are still 0 even though I had passsd few cases. Please
help me sir as my final score is coming as 69.8 , it will be very valuable for
me if it crosses 70, please sir help me with this regard

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Hi Sir,  
I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I put a lot of
effort into completing **Project1** , but I accidentally named the
**Dockerfile** as `dockerfile` (with a lowercase ‘d’).  
Could you please consider evaluating it with that name? I’d really appreciate
it.  
Thank you!
