Sir,  
I have facing lots of difficulties in assignments and it was taking alot of
time to solve a single assignment, so please extend the deadline for project 1
as it contains more weightage and it required more time to solve it.  
Please kindly consider my request, as I am from non-technical background it is
taking most of the time of a week because of which other Courses are
suffering.
