This thread is **not** about:  
_\- request to change grading pattern_  
_\- request to change ROE formula_  
_\- request to grant free marks_  
_\- to crib/cry for anything related to marks_

Here I wish to ask about:  
**Q.1:** what is that learning, which this course want us to prove through ROE
exam?  
**Q.2:** Is it possible to answer 17 questions fairly without fluking within
30 minutes using formal methods? (just by solving them properly)  
**Q.3:** What is the knowledge, using which I can solve all 17 questions
within 30 minutes (without fluking & without socializing/chatting/asking
(with) others)?

I feel, my Q3 is little bit combination of Q2 & Q1, still I am looking forward
for all 3 answers separately. Please help me to understand the real essence of
this ROE quiz.

Thanks in anticipation,

[@ankit.jain](/u/ankit.jain) – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure.
Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process.

**What does this RoE evaluate?** Implicit learning.

  * Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”
  * Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”

Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few
seconds.

Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit
learning. But it takes time.

Some, they just CAN’T find out. Maybe the terminology is unclear. Maybe their
skill set is different.

The RoE evaluates how much of learning is implicit. (Projects test how much is
explicit.)

**Can you answer 17 Q in 30 m?** Hopefully not.

I hope this is at the edge of the class’ competence. If multiple people answer
all 17, I’ll suggest 20 Q in 30 m next time, or pick tougher questions.

(This sounds harsh. Over time, though, I’ve come to value frank feedback over
polite encouragement.)

**What knowledge helps solve it this fast?** Practice.

3 strategies help.

  1. **Consistent practice**. Practice regularly. Pick problems just outside the edge of competence (fail 50% of the time).
  2. **Social learning**. Observe experts & peers and internalize their strategies. We’re social animals and learn faster through mimicry.
  3. **Emotional engagement**. If we like it or enjoy it, we learn faster. Practicing on real-world problems or problems we enjoy solving, working with people we enjoy, helps.

**Is it worth it?** Maybe not.

Not all implicit learning is worth it.

  1. You may not need it. 10 years ago, as a data scientist, scraping was worth learning implicitly. Today, as a manager, I’d just hire someone to do it.
  2. You may not be good at it. When I got a “D” in German, followed by a “D” in Japanese, I realized I’m just not mentally wired for human languages. It’d be too much effort to learn.

The RoE scores will give an idea of your implicit learning.

But your time is limited. Implicit learning is costly. Please focus your time
judiciously.

I check this term paper sir, I was written “This question paper is hackable”.
What that meant?
