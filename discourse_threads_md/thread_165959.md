[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content,
focusing on elements relevant to understanding the data and the potential
issue: **Image Content:** * **Title:** "What is the JSON data?" This clearly
indicates the purpose of the image is to display and inquire about a JSON data
structure. * **JSON Data (Incomplete and Incorrect):** There's a box
containing what appears to be JSON data. However, there are problems: *
**Syntax Errors:** The JSON is structured incorrectly. The order is messed up
and there's a closing brace "}" before the JSON actually begins, which is
likely contributing to the "Error." * **Key-Value Pairs:** It appears to have
the following key-value pairs, but not in the correct order or format: *
`"id": "tt7144296"` * `"title": "1. Kiss and Kill"` * `"year": 2017` *
`"rating": 2.9` * **Error Message:** * "Error: Expected: 2.9 Actual: 2.9" This
message suggests that the test expected the JSON to contain the value 2.9 for
some field, and the data *did* contain 2.9. This indicates that the issue
likely isn't the value itself, but likely the order or format of JSON **In
summary, the image shows an attempt to display JSON data. The data contains
keys like "id", "title", "year", and "rating", but has syntax errors that are
preventing it from being parsed correctly.** The error message, while pointing
to the "rating" field, is misleading and is more likely caused by the
incorrect overall structure.]Screenshot 2025-02-01 132301331×314 12.3

[@22f3001315](/u/22f3001315) [@21f3002277](/u/21f3002277)
[@24ds2000024](/u/24ds2000024) – please try again after reloading the page.
The new error message will be clearer, like this:

    
    
    Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4
    

FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can
sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can
sometimes be missing.

### Sakthivel S (2025-02-02T05:41:42.494Z)

In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the
evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?

edit: This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this
json might not be in this order tomorrow?

---
### Joel Jeffrey (2025-02-04T05:47:12.930Z)

Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full
score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and
would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to
that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?


---
### Anand S (2025-02-04T06:15:20.501Z)

[@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the
final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the
total.

Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any

HOW TO GET BBC API KEY  

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall
Layout:** * The image appears to be a screenshot of a programming assignment
or coding challenge interface. * It features a dark theme (background) with
colored highlights. * There's a header area with a due date, score, and
buttons ("Check all", "Save"). * The main content is divided into sections:
instructions, an example output, and a text input area for the user to provide
their answer. **Textual Content (Instructions):** The instructions outline a
series of tasks involving an API to retrieve and transform weather data. Let's
break them down: 1\. **API Integration and Data Retrieval:** The user needs to
use the BBC Weather API to get weather forecasts for "Tel Aviv." They should
use a GET request to a locator service to obtain the city's `locationId`.
Necessary query parameters like API key, locale, filters, and the search term
(city) are expected. 2\. **Weather Data Extraction:** The user needs to
retrieve the weather forecast data using the obtained `locationId` from the
first step. They should send a GET request to the weather broker API endpoint,
including the `locationId`. 3\. **Data Transformation:** This is the core
task. The user is required to: * Extract the `issueDate` and
`enhancedWeatherDescription` from each day's forecast data. * Iterate through
the `forecasts` array in the API response. * Map each `issueDate` to its
corresponding `enhancedWeatherDescription`. * Create a JSON object where each
key is the `issueDate` and the value is the `enhancedWeatherDescription`.
**Example Output:** The example provides a visual representation of the
expected output format. It shows a JSON object where dates (e.g.,
"2025-01-01") are keys, and the corresponding weather descriptions (e.g.,
"Sunny with scattered clouds") are the values. There's a comment "// ...
additional days" suggesting the output should include forecasts for multiple
days. **Input Area:** * There is a text input area labeled, "What is the JSON
weather forecast description for Tel Aviv?". * There's an error message
"SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input" which indicates that the user
might have started typing JSON code but hasn't completed it. **Overall, the
image presents a programming task where the user needs to interact with a
weather API, extract relevant data, and format it into a specific JSON
structure.** ]image1888×868 75.5 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

the file (as there was no menu is available to run manually) (I checked with
Copolit AI it says it is not correct to have cron jobs in a directory, I am
not sure) (2) when I submit the url to iitm I got the following error

### Tushar Jalan  (2025-02-04T09:14:53.054Z)

In the last two question of the ga,it is mentioned including both groups.so
what is the meaning of this .  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image's content:
**Overall Content:** The image presents a task description, outlining a data
analysis challenge related to student marks. It includes instructions on how
to extract, clean, filter, and calculate data from a PDF file containing
student marks in various subjects. The image also highlights the potential
benefits of automating such data analysis for a school. **Key Textual
Elements:** * **Title/Task:** "Your Task" * **File Reference:** "This file,
q-extract-tables-from-pdf.pdf contains a table of student marks in Maths,
Physics, English, Economics, and Biology." * **Main Objective:** "Calculate
the total Biology marks of students who scored 17 or more marks in Physics in
groups 43-66 (including both groups)." * **Numbered Steps (Data Analysis
Process):** * **1. Data Extraction:** Mentions retrieving the PDF and using
libraries like Tabula, Camelot, or PyPDF2. Suggests converting the data into
CSV, Excel, or a DataFrame. * **2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:** States the
need to convert marks to numerical data types. * **3. Data Filtering:**
Instructions to identify students who have scores between 17 and Physics in
groups 43-66 (including both groups). * **4. Calculation:** Instructions to
Sum the marks of the filtered students to obtain the total marks for this
specific cohort. * **Benefits of Automation (EduAnalytics):** * "Identify
Performance Trends" * "Allocate Resources Effectively" * "Enhance Reporting
Efficiency" * "Support Data-Driven Strategies" * **Repetition of Main
Objective (Question):** "What is the total Biology marks of students who
scored 17 or more marks in Physics in groups 43-66 (including both groups)?"
**Relevant Features for Answering Questions:** * **The specific subjects
involved:** Maths, Physics, English, Economics, and Biology. * **The key
subject and condition:** Focus on Biology marks where Physics marks are 17 or
more within groups 43-66. * **The tools suggested for data extraction:**
Tabula, Camelot, PyPDF2. * **The desired output format:** Numerical data
types. * **The need for filtering data based on a score range and group
numbers:** 17 or more in Physics and groups 43-66. In essence, the image
presents a data manipulation problem where a student marks table needs to be
processed to extract a specific sum of Biology scores based on a condition in
Physics scores. ]image1622×601 85.5 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

Hi Tushar,

If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been
grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both
groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.

kind regards

Also what does this " It is _very hard_ to get the correct Markdown output

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content: The
image shows a snippet from an educational platform, likely related to a
computer science or document processing task. Here's a breakdown: **Content
Elements:** * **Title:** "q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf has the contents of a sample
document." This indicates the exercise involves converting a PDF file into
Markdown format. * **Instructions (Numbered List):** 1\. "Convert the PDF to
Markdown: Extract the content from the PDF file. Accurately convert the
extracted content into Markdown format, preserving the structure and
formatting as much as possible." 2\. "Format the Markdown: Use Prettier
version 3.4.2 to format the converted Markdown file." 3\. "Submit the
Formatted Markdown: Provide the final, formatted Markdown file as your
submission." * **"Impact" Section:** This section describes the benefits of
automating PDF to Markdown conversion. It highlights the contribution to
EduDocs Inc.'s mission. It's followed by a bulleted list: * "Enhances
Productivity: Reduces the time and effort required to prepare documentation
for clients." * "Improves Quality: Ensures all documents adhere to
standardized formatting, enhancing readability and professionalism." *
"Supports Scalability: Enables EduDocs to handle larger volumes of
documentation without compromising on quality." * "Facilitates Integration:
Makes it easier to integrate Markdown-formatted documents into various digital
platforms and content management systems." * **"What is the markdown content
of the PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?"** This is the prompt for the
user's input. * **Text Input Box:** A text box follows the prompt, where the
user is supposed to enter the Markdown content. The text currently entered is:
* "Ater vulnero solio tabula." * "Auctus benigne coaegresco defetiscor

aro cruentus arbustum. Abstergo alii sollers." * "---" * **Feedback/Error
Message:** "Incorrect. Try again." indicates that the user's input was not
correct. * **Hint/Explanation:** "It is very hard to get the correct Markdown
output from a PDF. Any method you use will likely require manual corrections.
Reformatting with Prettier helps standardize the output format for
comparison." This provides context about the difficulty of the task and
suggests the importance of manual corrections and Prettier's role.
**Overall:** The image is a screenshot of a coding/formatting exercise focused
on converting PDF content to Markdown and formatting it with a specific
version of Prettier. The user has attempted to provide the correct Markdown
output, but it was marked as incorrect, suggesting an error in the Markdown
syntax or formatting. The hint acknowledges the complexity and the need for
manual intervention. ]image1327×743 41.6 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown
content but it was incorrect all the time.

I have tried these steps:

    
    
    import pymupdf4llm
    md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")
    
    import pathlib
    pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())
    

Then i run this in bash

    
    
    prettier --write output.md
    

And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups,
and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw
the preview, it does matches with the pdf.

#Can someone please advise me a better approach?

try manually inspecting the output of the api and compare it with your script

Or else try refreshing the browser and check.

Q4 BBC Weather

I don’t understand why I am getting

> Error: At root: Different number of properties

Is it because of different dates? Shall I match the dates?

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Please guide. Thank you.

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image's content: **Task
Description:** The image describes a task involving the development of a
system to automate fetching and processing weather data. The steps are: 1\.
**API Integration and Data Retrieval:** Using the BBC Weather API. 2\.
**Weather Data Extraction:** Retrieving forecast data. 3\. **Data
Transformation:** Extracting the `issueDate` and `enhancedWeatherDescription`,
to create an enhanced weather description. **Expected Output Format:** The
image shows an example of the desired output format, which is a JSON-like
structure (dictionary or object) where: * Keys: Dates in the format "YYYY-MM-
DD" * Values: Weather descriptions (e.g., "Sunny with scattered clouds")
**Question and Answer:** * **Question:** "What is the JSON weather forecast
description for Osaka?" * **Answer (User-Provided):** A JSON structure with
keys being dates in February 2025, and values are weather descriptions.
**Error Message:** The error message displayed is: * "Error: At root:
Different number of properties" This likely means that the number of key-value
pairs provided in the JSON input does not correspond to the expected number.
**Other Elements:** * A "Check" button at the bottom. * Arrows in the bottom
and left sides of the image pointing towards key-value pairs in JSON inputs.
**In summary, the image shows a programming task, the expected output format,
the user's attempt at providing the correct format, and an error message
indicating a mismatch in the number of properties. The task involves using a
weather API and transforming the data into a specific JSON-like structure.**

Hi Mishkat

Please refer to this post.

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image shows a headshot of a man. The background is a
neutral, slightly warm yellow/cream color, providing contrast and putting
focus on the subject. **Subject Description:** * **Gender:** Male * **Age:**
Likely in his late 20s to mid-30s (educated guess based on appearance). *
**Ethnicity:** Difficult to determine with certainty, but he appears to have
South Asian features. * **Hair:** Dark, short, and neatly styled. * **Facial
Features:** * He is wearing rectangular framed glasses. * He has a faint
smile. * **Clothing:** Wearing a dark purple, collared shirt. **Other
Details:** * **Lighting:** The lighting appears to be fairly even and soft,
suggesting a studio or well-lit indoor environment. * **Image Quality:** The
image quality seems decent, with reasonable sharpness. * **Composition:** The
composition is a classic headshot. He is looking mostly straight at the
camera.] [GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan

the error messages are more helpful. Please give it a shot now.

Missing links, Missing tables…

But on checking the file i wasn’t able to find any single table in the

(I tried with other symbols * and + also) . Please inform me where I made
mistake  

[[Image description: Here's a description of the image, focusing on the
elements relevant to creating Markdown content: **Overall Layout:** * The
image appears to be a screen capture or a section of a document. * It's framed
by a rectangular border (likely the edge of a UI element or the document
itself). * The dominant element is a list of short phrases, each preceded by a
hyphen. This strongly suggests a Markdown list. **Textual Content:** *
**Title:** "What is the markdown content of the PDF, formatted with
prettier@3.4.2?" This indicates that the goal is to represent some content
from a PDF in Markdown format, and that the content has been processed with
the Prettier code formatter version 3.4.2. * **List Items:** The core of the
content is a list: * `- cuppedia tamquam facilis confugo` * `- conservo
depereo` * `- consectetur arx` * `- aeternus celebrer` **Possible Markdown
Structure:** Based on the visible content, the Markdown representation would
likely be a simple unordered list. **Error Indication:** * At the bottom,
there's an "Error: Missing lists" message. This suggests that the process of
extracting Markdown might have had some issues correctly identifying or
formatting list structures from the PDF. In summary, the image depicts a
request to generate Markdown from a PDF and provides a list of strings that
appear to have originated from that PDF. It also includes an error message
pointing to a problem in the Markdown extraction or formatting. ]image1108×271

Even I’m getting a similar error in Q2, it is expecting a foreign title
whereas my search result gives only English titles.  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall:** The image presents a question "What is the JSON data?" followed
by a JSON object snippet enclosed in a pink rectangular box. Below the JSON

### Siddhardh Devulapalli (2025-02-07T11:06:49.504Z)

I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to
manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use
the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert
pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make
it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.

Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.

What format is required for the “missing links” here  

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall
Structure:** The image appears to be a screenshot of an interactive exercise
or quiz related to Markdown formatting. The theme is dark. **Key Text
Elements:** * **Title:** "Impact" * **Introduction:** A paragraph explaining
that the exercise contributes to EduDocs Inc.'s mission of providing high-
quality, accessible educational resources by automating PDF to Markdown
conversion and ensuring consistent formatting. * **Bulleted List:** *
"Enhances Productivity": Reduces time and effort for documentation. *
"Improves Quality": Ensures adherence to standardized formatting, enhancing
readability and professionalism. * "Supports Scalability": Enables handling
larger volumes of documentation without compromising quality. * "Facilitates
Integration": Makes it easier to integrate Markdown-formatted documents into
digital platforms. * **Question Prompt:** "What is the markdown content of the
PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?" * **Text Area/Editor:** A large area with
code or text that appears to be the user's answer to the question. The text
content within this area includes Latin-like text: * Audax teneo centum
cilicium vigor venio. * Patria credo tonsor. * Defessus pax volup vomito
creator video campana cedo vita votum. * Laudantium victoria aer via tepidus.
* Adulescens corporis triumphus coruscus sordeo trans dolorum. * **Error
Message:** "Error: Missing links". It's at the bottom of the text area. *
**Disclaimer:** A paragraph acknowledging the difficulty of getting correct
Markdown output from PDFs and clarifying that the question only checks a few
basic things. **Objects/Features:** * The use of bullet points to list
features/advantages. * The text area suggests an interactive coding or text
editing environment. * A scrollbar on the side of the text area, indicating
more content exists within. * An error icon near the error message. **In
summary, the image depicts an interactive exercise focused on converting PDF
content to Markdown format, with a specific emphasis on correct formatting
using "prettier@3.4.2". The error message indicates that the user's answer is
missing some links, implying there might be hyperlinks or other elements that
need to be properly rendered in the Markdown output.**]image1973×849 93.6

  1. There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.  
All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear
as link texts same as in pdf.

Link text

Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to
link texts,  
below error is still observed.

Error: Missing links

Did anyone else face same issue ?

  2. Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.  
But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by
using markdown code syntax that error is gone.

Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.

i am facing a similar issue

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **1. Example
Output Format:** * The image shows a sample JSON-like structure for weather
forecasts. * Each forecast is a key-value pair. * The key is a date in "YYYY-
MM-DD" format (e.g., "2025-01-01"). * The value is a string describing the
weather condition for that date (e.g., "Sunny with scattered clouds"). * The
example suggests that there could be additional dates represented by the "//
... additional days" comment. **2. Question/Task:** * The user is asked to
provide a JSON weather forecast description specifically for Shanghai. **3.
User's Attempted Answer:** * The user has entered a JSON-like structure for
Shanghai's weather forecast, with dates in February 2025. * The structure
contains weather descriptions for "2025-02-07" through "2025-02-11". * The
format of the dates and weather descriptions appears to match the example.
**4. Error Message:** * An error message is displayed: "Error: At root:
Different number of properties". * This error message suggests that the format
or structure of the JSON provided by the user doesn't align with what the
system expects (possibly in terms of the number of forecast days required). In
essence, the user is trying to provide a JSON formatted answer to a weather
forecast question but running into an error indicating an issue with the
structure of the user input.]image1746×766 56.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

I am also facing the same issue. What is the problem here?  

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall:** The
image shows a coding task or exercise likely on a platform for learning about
APIs and data manipulation. It appears to be related to retrieving weather
forecasts from the BBC Weather API and transforming the data into a JSON
format. The user has attempted to complete the task, but there is an error.
**Key Textual Elements:** * **Title/Instructions:** * The instructions guide
the user through the following steps: * API Integration and Data Retrieval:
Use the BBC Weather API. * Weather Data Extraction. * Data Transformation:
Extract issueDate and enhancedWeatherDescription. * **Expected Output
Example:** An example JSON output is provided with date as the key and weather
description as the value. * **User Input:** The user has provided a JSON-like
structure representing weather forecasts for London, with dates as keys and
weather descriptions as values. * **Error Message:** "Error: At root: Property
name mismatch" **Visual Elements and Analysis:** * **Layout:** The screen is
divided into sections: problem description, expected output, user input area,
and a "Check" button. * **Coding Interface:** The input area suggests the user
is directly editing code or data in a text editor/IDE interface. * **Error
Indication:** The error message at the bottom of the screen indicates a
problem with the structure or content of the user's JSON input. **Problem
Analysis:** The "Property name mismatch" error likely stems from incorrect
syntax in the provided JSON. It could be the issue of not using proper double
quotes to surround keys and values. **In Summary:** The image depicts a JSON
manipulation task involving weather data from an API, with a user encountering
an error due to incorrect JSON syntax, specifically a mismatch in the format
of the keys or values within the JSON object. ]image1788×908 77.9

### Anand S (2025-02-08T03:23:12.990Z)

[@21F1005510](/u/21f1005510) Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names.
For example, [The Recruit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) is [also
known as Graymail in
India](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas).
My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual
corrections for a few titles.

**Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?** Because this
is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to
create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in
automation.

Content:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a coding challenge or quiz

that the structure provided in the JSON data does not align with the expected

### Sarang Tambe (2025-02-08T05:37:22.199Z)

This is the only thing which worked for me.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example
output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats
(instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it
would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as
reported in IMDB. The current example on the portal is:  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Content:**
The image shows a snippet of code, specifically a JSON-like structure. It
appears to represent a list (array) of movie data. Each movie is represented
as an object with the following key-value pairs: * **"id"**: A string, likely
the unique identifier for the movie (e.g., "tt1234567", "tt7654321"). *
**"title"**: A string representing the movie title (e.g., "Movie 1", "Movie
2"). * **"year"**: An integer representing the year the movie was released
(e.g., 2021, 2019). * **"rating"**: A floating-point number representing the
movie's rating (e.g., 5.8, 6.2). **Structure:** The code snippet is enclosed
in square brackets `[ ]`, indicating an array. Each movie object is enclosed
in curly braces `{}`. The key-value pairs within each object are separated by
colons `:` and pairs are separated by commas `,`. **Incompleteness:** The
snippet contains the line `"// ... more titles"`, indicating that the list of
movies is not fully displayed. This suggests that the image represents a
partial view of a larger dataset. **Visual Style:** The code is presented in a
dark theme, with the text appearing in a light color (likely white or light
blue) against a dark background. This is a common style for code editors or
terminals. ]image1580×196 4.81 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?

In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite
using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this
issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared
to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time
rather than IST.  
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.

Good idea [@23f2005138](/u/23f2005138) and thanks. I fixed this. The example
now reads:

    
    
    [
      { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },
      { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" },
    

… with the year and ratings quoted.

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons,
for which hyphenated “years” are given.

For the particular instance - `“2024–”`, it appears another season/part is
announced, thats why it is written that way.

made mistake. During writing console code I added to remove non numeric values

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
I don’t understand this error. In the website, the movie name doesn’t have a
colon “:”, but in the result it is expecting so.

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Content Overview:** The image shows a snippet of JSON-like data. This data
appears to represent information about a movie or similar media. Below the
JSON data, there's an error message, indicating a validation failure. **JSON
Data:** The JSON data includes the following key-value pairs: * **"id"**:
"tt8790086" (Presumably an identifier code) * **"title"**: "11. Kraven the
Hunter" (The title of the media) * **"year"**: "2024" (The year of release or
creation) * **"rating"**: "5.4" (A rating score) **Error Message:** The error
message states: * **Error Location**: "At [10].title" (Suggests this is an
error within a 10th item or element, specifically at the 'title' field) *
**Type of Error**: "Values don't match." * **Expected Value**: "11. Kraven:
The Hunter" (The value that was expected) * **Actual Value**: "11. Kraven the
Hunter" (The value that was found) **Overall Impression:** The image indicates
that a data validation process has failed. The title field in the JSON data
doesn't match the expected value. The difference seems to be a missing colon
(":") in the actual title compared to the expected title. ]image1005×250 15.4

For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the
assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description.
Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in
your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can
then use to verify the date and description.

correct. just give a try.

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on
the text and relevant features: **Overall Content:** The image shows a
computer screen or webpage displaying a programming task related to weather
data integration. The task is part of a learning exercise or challenge. It
involves fetching, processing, and transforming weather data from the BBC
Weather API for a specific location (Manila). **Text Breakdown:** * **Title:**
"Weather Data Integration for AgroTech Insights" * **Introductory
Paragraphs:** Explain that AgroTech Insights is an agricultural technology
company that uses weather data to help farmers. It highlights the importance
of accurate weather forecasts. * **"Your Task":** This section outlines the
steps required to complete the task: * **API Integration and Data Retrieval:**
Instructs the user to use the BBC Weather API to get the weather forecast for
Manila. This includes using the API key, locale, filters and the city name to
obtain the location ID. * **Weather Data Extraction:** Retrieve the weather
forecast data using the obtained location Id. * **Data Transformation:**
Extract the issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription from each day's forecast.
It asks the user to create a JSON object mapping the issueDate to the
corresponding enhancedweatherDescription. * **Example Output:** A JSON-like
structure showing how the transformed data should look: ```json {
"2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds", "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with
a chance of rain", "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies", // ... additional days }
``` * **Question:** "What is the JSON weather forecast description for
Manila?" * **Answer Field:** This contains JSON-like code, appearing to be the
user's attempt at answering the question. It forecasts the weather for "Sunny
and a gentle breeze" for the dates 2025-02-16 to 2025-02-20. ```json {
"2025-02-16": "Sunny and a gentle breeze", "2025-02-17": "Sunny and a gentle
breeze", "2025-02-18": "Sunny and a gentle breeze", "2025-02-19": "Sunny and a
gentle breeze", "2025-02-20": "Sunny and a gentle breeze" } ``` * **Button:**
"Check" - likely used to submit the answer for evaluation. **Relevant
Features:** * The reference to the BBC Weather API indicates a specific source
for weather data. * The focus on JSON format highlights the importance of
structured data. * The dates used in the example and answer suggest a
forecasting scenario. * The instructions and example provide a clear
definition of what is expected in the answer. In summary, the image presents a
programming challenge focused on integrating and transforming weather data
from an API into a structured JSON format. The user is tasked with providing a
JSON representation of the weather forecast for Manila. ]image1358×1151 179

multiple titles need to be translated by this method.

I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be
constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed
on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json
outcome. Anyways the new json with same issueDate also gives the same Root
error

### Harshit Chaturvedi (2025-02-08T16:50:28.081Z)

Double-check that the rating field in the JSON is indeed a float (`2.9`) and
not a string (`"2.9"`) in your code.


---
### Shambhavi  (2025-02-08T16:55:58.503Z)

That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf.
Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely
hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by
the original method.

But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do
so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by
establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the
console to get the expected output.


---
### Shambhavi  (2025-02-08T17:02:30.525Z)

Write the code referencing the provided collab file and make sure to use the
API key  
The output actually changes once in a while so you might need to run the code
a few times before getting in right

Please clarify, sharing code and output below for reference.

Code:

    weather_data = {}
    
    for i in range(len(json_data['forecasts'])): # Use range to create an iterable sequence of indices
      issue_date = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['issueDate']
      weather_description = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['report']['enhancedWeatherDescription']
      weather_data[issue_date]=weather_description

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** * The image appears to be a screenshot of a web page,
likely from GitHub, specifically related to GitHub Actions workflows. * It's a

Please ensure that your .yml file should have step name as your email Id. then
Manually trigger the task (don’t wait till the scheduled time), ensure it was
committed within 5 minutes and that commit should be top most item in all
workflows. Then check it, it will work

When I resave the questions, the previously correct questions turn wrong which
is extremely frustrating and time taking. I wish there is an option which
saves the correct answer and does not require us to have multiple processes
running in our pc even after getting the answer right previously.

Content:** * The main content area of the page displays "Pretty-print"
followed by a checkbox-like symbol (likely an unchecked checkbox). * Below
that, the number "44" is printed. **General Observations:** * The theme

Sir I have solved Q2, But a problem arises that, At the index 11, in the IMdb
website it is listed “The Recruit” but it is showing Expected: “Graymail”.  

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Content:** *
The image contains a series of JSON-like entries representing movies or TV
shows. Each entry seems to have the following keys: "id," "title," "year," and
"rating." * The entries are presented in a row-by-row format. * At the bottom
is an error message. It indicates a mismatch between an "expected" and
"actual" value for the "title" key at index/position 11. The expected value is
"12. Graymail" but the actual value is "12. The Recruit". **Error message:** *
"Error: At \\[11].title: Values don't match. Expected: "12. Graymail". Actual:
"12. The Recruit" **Observations:** * The data in the image looks like it's
been processed by Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and OCR may have made
some mistakes in recognizing characters. * The formatting suggests it's part
of a data validation or comparison process. * The last entry in the array has
been poorly recognized by OCR. In summary, the image presents a snippet of
data (likely movies or TV shows) in a JSON-like format, along with an error
message highlighting a discrepancy in the "title" field of one entry. The
"year" and "rating" fields also have OCR artifacts such as extra
dashes.]problem621×159 42.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

### Shambhavi  (2025-02-09T05:52:35.938Z)

Yes …due to the location difference the search results are different for
everyone therefore you need to adjust it accordingly  
It might need around 6-7 amendments


---
### Shambhavi  (2025-02-09T06:13:36.894Z)

The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output
However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they
represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated.  
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values:  
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00  
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00  
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00
AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather
description for each day, you need to modify your approach by using the actual
forecast day for each day instead.

if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me.

Please help with the second issue.

  1. For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.  
How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5
min. Now it works.

> Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.

  2. I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Structure:** The image captures a section of a digital assignment or
exercise, likely within a learning platform or web application. The topic
appears to involve simulating content acquisition strategies for a streaming
service named "StreamFlix". The user is expected to submit JSON data related
to a movie or TV show. **Textual Elements:** * **"4. Submit: Submit the JSON
data in the text box below."** - This is an instruction heading. *
**"Impact"** - This is a heading likely describing the purpose of the
exercise. * A descriptive paragraph explains the simulation aspect and its
connection to StreamFlix's content strategy, subscriber satisfaction, and
business growth. * **"What is the JSON data?"** - A question prompting the
user for the data. * A text box contains a JSON object with the following keys
and (incorrect) values: * `"id": "tt26584495"` * `"title": "10. Companion -
Die perfekte Begleitung"` * `"year": "2025"` * `"rating": "7.4"` * **Error
Message:** An error message is displayed below the JSON data: "Error: At
[10].year. Values don't match. Expected: "2021-". Actual: "2021"" This
indicates that the year value "2025" is incorrect; the expected value is
"2021". * A disclaimer states that IMDb search results might differ by region,
and translation/scraper code re-running may be necessary. **Graphical
Elements:** * There's a text box with a red error indicator, containing the
JSON data. * The image is likely a screenshot of a web page with dark theme
enabled. **Inference:** The assignment requires the user to provide accurate
JSON data for a movie or TV show. The error message suggests that the entered
"year" value is incorrect, possibly based on data fetched from IMDb or a
similar database. The user needs to correct the "year" value to "2021" to
resolve the error. ]image1701×699 64.6 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

### Avinash Kumar (2025-02-09T07:21:17.635Z)

City in my question is `Nur-Sultan` .When i search `Nur-Sultan` city name in
BBC weather page .its show nothing . when i search in google then show Nur
Sultan become Astana . then i am going this city name "Astana ". and got
location id 1526273. after i run in collab then showing error.  

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall:** The
image shows a computer screen displaying Python code and a traceback error.
The code seems to be fetching weather data, and the error indicates a problem
with accessing a list index. **Code Snippets:** * **Date Range Creation:** *
`datelist = pd.date_range(datetime.today(),
periods=len(daily_summary_list)).tolist()` * Creates a list of dates,
potentially using the length of `daily_summary_list` to determine the number
of days. * `datelist = [date.date().strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for date in
datelist]` * Formats the dates in the `datelist` to a "YYYY-MM-DD" string
format. * **Mapping Dates to Descriptions:** * `weather_data = {date: desc for
date, desc in zip(datelist, daily_summary_list)}` * Likely creates a
dictionary (`weather_data`) mapping dates to weather descriptions. `zip` is
used to iterate over the `datelist` and `daily_summary_list` simultaneously. *
**JSON Conversion:** * `weather_json = json.dumps(weather_data, indent=4)` *
Converts the `weather_data` dictionary to a JSON string with an indent of 4
spaces. * `print(weather_json)` * Prints the JSON output. **Error Traceback:**
* **Error Type:** `IndexError: list index out of range` * **Location of
Error:** * `<ipython-input-1-854dd394d4e3> in <cell line: 8>()` * Specific
line with problem: `24 weather_url = 'https://www.bbc.com/weather/' +
result['response'] ['results"]["results"][@]['id']` **Line-by-Line Explanation
of Traceback:** * `22 # Fetch location data` (Comment) * `23 result =
requests.get(location_url).json()` (Fetches JSON data from `location_url`) *
`24 weather_url = 'https://www.bbc.com/weather/' +
result['response']['results']['results'][0]['id']` (Error occurs here) - This
line appears to be constructing a URL. The error likely means one of these
things: * `result['response']` doesn't exist or is None. *
`result['response']['results']` doesn't exist or is None. *
`result['response']['results']['results']` doesn't exist or is None. * The
list `result['response']['results']['results']` is empty, so accessing `[0]`
causes an error. * `result['response']['results']['results'][0]['id']` doesn't
exist or is None. * `25` (Blank line) * `26 # Fetch weather data` (Comment)
**Interpretation:** The error suggests the code is trying to access an element
in a list (or a nested list within a dictionary) using an index (specifically
`[0]`), but the list is either empty or the index is out of bounds. This
commonly happens when the API call (`requests.get(location_url).json()`)
doesn't return the expected data structure, or when the data is missing in the
API response. **Possible Causes and Solutions:** 1\. **API Response
Structure:** The structure of the JSON response from the `location_url` might
be different than expected. Debug by printing `result` to see the actual
structure. 2\. **Missing Data:** The "response," "results," or "id" keys might
be missing in the JSON response. Check for this and handle these cases with
conditional checks or default values. 3\. **Empty List:** The list accessed
with `[0]` might be empty. Add a check to ensure the list has at least one
element before attempting to access `[0]`. **In summary:** The error is an
`IndexError`, which means the code is trying to access an element in a list
that doesn't exist at that index. This is likely due to unexpected data from
the API or missing data in the API response. Debugging the API response
`result` and adding error handling will resolve this issue. ]WhatsApp Image

#question 10  
Hi, Can anyone help me with Question 10?  
No matter how i try to post the markdown, it is always showing that either the
words are missing or are different from the original. I have tried every
possible way i could think of but it is not working.

### Shambhavi  (2025-02-09T12:11:40.484Z)

Getting this question right is a tough nut to crack…so I would rather suggest
you to do using the developer tools by inspecting the source code and putting
the breakpoint followed by writing the code in the console to retrieve the
expected answer

Hi Team,

I have made the JSON from the IMDB website using JS, But do i miss any filter
conditions,  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a program or application,
possibly related to data analysis or web scraping. It displays a section
labeled "What is the JSON data?" followed by what looks like a snippet of JSON
code. An error message is present at the bottom, suggesting a discrepancy
between expected and actual values. **JSON Data Snippet:** The identified JSON
snippet contains the following key-value pairs: * `"year"`: `"2024"` *
`"rating"`: `"6.0"` * `"id"`: `"tt30292390"` **Error Message:** The error
message provides the following information: * **Location:** `[10].title`
(Likely referring to the 10th entry in a list or array and specifically
targeting the "title" field). * **Error:** Values don't match. * **Expected:**
`"11. Sebastian Fitzeks Der Heimweg"` * **Actual:** `"11. The Calendar
Killer"` **Additional Notes:** * The message "IMDb search results may differ
by region..." suggests that the application is interacting with IMDb's
database. * The suggestion to "manually translate titles" and "re-run your
scraper code" indicates a potential issue with regional differences in movie
titles or outdated data. In summary, the image shows a portion of a program
displaying JSON data related to movies or TV shows, along with an error
message stemming from a mismatch in titles between an expected and actual
result, likely due to regional differences or scraping inaccuracies.

[[Image description: Here's a description of the image's content: The image
shows a question related to extracting Markdown content from a PDF and
formatting it using Prettier version 3.4.2. A text box displays a block of
Markdown code. The Markdown code seems to represent a table with two columns,
followed by some additional text. The "Correct" label indicates that the
provided Markdown content is the expected output. The provided Markdown code
consists of the following elements: 1\. `|adficio|chirographum|`: A row in a

In the 10th question, how do we add headings and links to the markdown
output?(getting error: Headings missing)


---
### NamanBeri (2025-02-09T13:00:26.515Z)

first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the
errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors

yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a
way to trick the checking system.

but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash,
javascript, whole redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but
i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on
details relevant for answering questions: **Overall Structure:** * The image
appears to be a screenshot of a web interface, likely an educational or
coding-related application. **Textual Elements:** * **JSON Code Snippets:**
There are two JSON-like snippets displayed. * The first shows weather
forecasts for dates in January 2025, with descriptions like "Sunny with
scattered clouds," "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain," and "Overcast
skies." It notes that there are additional days not shown. * The second
snippet is presented as the weather forecast for Nur-Sultan. It covers dates
in February 2025 (14, 18, 19, 20, 21), with descriptions like "Light snow and
a gentle breeze," "Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze," "Light cloud and a
gentle breeze," and "Sunny and a moderate breeze." Note the formatting error
in the first line of the second JSON snippet. * **Question:** "What is the
JSON weather forecast description for Nur-Sultan?" This clearly indicates that
the second JSON snippet is the answer. * **Error Message:** "TypeError: Cannot
read properties of undefined (reading 'id')" This suggests a JavaScript error
occurring in the application, possibly related to how the JSON data is being
processed. * **Buttons:** A "Check" button is visible, implying an interactive
element where the user can submit their answer. **Key Objects and Features:**
* **JSON Data Representation:** The use of JSON syntax (key-value pairs)
indicates the data is structured in a standard format for data exchange. *
**Date Format:** Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2025-01-01"). *
**Weather Descriptions:** The values associated with the dates are brief text
descriptions of weather conditions. **In summary, the image presents a
question about extracting weather forecast information from a JSON snippet.
The user needs to identify the JSON representing the Nur-Sultan forecast from
the provided snippets.** ]image835×606 34.6 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

Hi, please ensure that your repository is public, if private the response
would be 404. If workflow runs is not found, it might be that the number of
API calls to your profile/repo might have exceeded, it usually gets reset at
the end of the day. Please try again after sometime)

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image's content, focusing on
elements relevant to understanding the task: **Overall Structure:** * The
image shows a coding exercise environment, likely an online platform for
learning or testing. * There's a header with a timer ("03:08:26 left"), score
("Score: 7/10"), and options like "Check all" and "Save." * The main content
is a coding assignment with instructions and a space for the user to input
their solution. * At the bottom, there's an error message and a helpful note
about the complexity of the task. **Key Textual Elements:** * **Task Title:**
"Markdown and ensuring their consistent formatting." * **Context:** The task
is related to EduDocs' commitment to providing high-quality educational
resources. * **File Reference:** "q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf" (suggests the
exercise involves converting a PDF to Markdown). * **Instructions:** * Convert
the PDF to Markdown: Extract content and preserve structure/formatting. *
Format the Markdown: Use Prettier version 3.4.2. * Submit the Formatted
Markdown. * **Impact Section:** Explains the benefits of automating PDF to
Markdown conversion: * Enhances Productivity * Improves Quality * Supports
Scalability * Facilitates Integration * **Question Prompt:** "What is the
markdown content of the PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?" * **Code Input
Area:** A text input field (likely for the user's Markdown solution). The
image already shows some preliminary attempts at Markdown content, indicating
some progress. * **Error Message:** "Error: Missing code" * **Disclaimer:** A
note acknowledging that perfect Markdown conversion from PDF is difficult and
that the question focuses on basic aspects. **Code Snippets in the Input Area
(Likely Incorrect):** * `[tricesimus admitto](https://example.com/tricesimus-
admitto)` * `Suggero comes denique argentum. Desipio crudelis antea quis.` *
`[adeptio colligo](https://example.com/adeptio-colligo)` **Interpretation:**
The exercise requires the user to extract content from a PDF file, convert it
to Markdown format, and then format it using the Prettier code formatter
(version 3.4.2). The user has already started entering some Markdown code, but
the "Missing code" error indicates the solution is incomplete or incorrect.
The snippet implies the user knows the general markdown syntax for links and
paragraphs. However, given the disclaimer at the bottom, the exercise likely
focuses on basic Markdown elements rather than complex formatting. **In
essence, the user needs to provide the correct Markdown representation of the
content found within the (unseen) "q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf" file.**

The IMDB and weather questions was a pain along with the 10th question, wasted
so much time [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , the questions were nowhere tough, it was
the problems with the evaluation part i had spend hours just to sit and
correct the JSON file and no comments on the 10th question’s part.

I am fine with the academia being challenging to study not the evalation
making me manually edit solutions

### Rohit Garg (2025-02-09T16:15:41.126Z)

i 'm here for the bonus marks,

But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts
towards this.

We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the
course.

And i have never seen any course cool as this,

  * like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (_and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom :sweat_smile:, gave client side answer checks’s code to`o1` and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this_)
  * keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI.  
( _i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that
problem :smiling_face_with_tear:_)

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content,
focusing on text and relevant features: **Overall Layout and Theme:** * The
image appears to be a screenshot of a web page. * The page uses a dark color
scheme. * Sections are organized within bordered rectangles. **Top Section -
Discourse Discussion:** * Contained within a cyan-bordered rectangle, text
reads: "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse". * It suggests a
platform for asking questions related to the content of the page. **Second
Section - Bonus Marks:** * Contained within a dark green-bordered rectangle,
the text reads: "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse". * It explains the
rules for bonus marks: * IITM BS students who reply to the discussion on "GA4
- Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" with a relevant question
or reply will get 1 bonus mark on the graded assignment. **Third Section -
Login Information:** * A paragraph reads: "You are logged in as
22f2001394@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." indicating a user's logged-in status. * A
"Logout" button is available. **Fourth Section - Recent Saves:** * A heading
reads: "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)". * A list of recent
save records appears: * Each record has a "Reload" link. * It includes the
date and time of the save (2/9/2025), followed by the score. * The records
show the following scores and times: * 9:26:17 PM. Score: 10 * 7:48:07 PM.
Score: 8 * 7:44:44 PM. Score: 8 **Summary:** The image captures a webpage
interface, likely related to an IITM BS assignment. It highlights the
opportunity to earn bonus marks through participation in a discussion forum.

learning platform. ]image1483×687 48.1 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

if you look closely the expected value is `2024- ` and actual that you are

Difference ? your value does have a `-` and a space at the end.  
reason ? you might be scraping it ? `trim()` or maybe using `innerText` to get

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Content:**
The image shows a single, capitalized letter "M" rendered in a light, almost
white color with a subtle, soft shadow effect. The background is a solid,
muted blue-gray color. The "M" is the central and only object in the image.
**Key Features:** * **Letter:** The letter "M" is the primary element. It
appears to be sans-serif and proportionally centered. * **Color Palette:** The
image utilizes a simple, monochromatic color scheme with varying shades of
blue and gray. The light "M" contrasts gently against the darker background. *
**Shadowing:** The subtle shadow provides a sense of depth to the letter,
making it slightly raised or three-dimensional. * **Resolution:** The image
seems to be of relatively low resolution, as there is some noticeable
pixelation, especially around the edges of the letter. **Possible Questions It
Could Help Answer:** * Is there any text in the image? (Yes, the letter "M").
* What color is the letter? (A light, off-white or light gray). * What is the
background color? (A muted blue-gray). * Are there any special effects on the
letter? (A subtle shadow). Overall, it's a simple image of the letter "M"
designed for clarity and visibility against a contrasting background.]

overall image quality is somewhat low, leading to reduced clarity of finer
details. **Details:** * **Person:** The image prominently features a man. He
appears to be smiling slightly. He is wearing a striped shirt, with colors
that appear to be navy and white. He seems to be wearing blue jeans as well. *
**Background:** The background is blurry, but it appears to be an indoor
setting. Possible decorative elements can be seen but are unclear. * **Other
Features:** He is sitting in a blue chair. Without higher resolution or
additional context, this is the most information I can extract from the
image.] [GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan

Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc
servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present
in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed
in the bbc database as Astana.  
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to
extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana
and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the
following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
‘id’)”

### B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA (2025-02-09T18:10:54.794Z)

you are missing code block

Normal : print(123)  
Code Block : `print(123)`

you can refer to week 2 q1 for the syntax of code block

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image's content:
**Overall Impression:** The image shows a question followed by what appears to
be a representation of JSON data. The JSON is a list of movie entries, each
containing details like title, year, rating, and a unique ID. There's also an
error message displayed at the bottom. **Key Elements:** 1\. **Question:** At
the top, it asks "What is the JSON data?". 2\. **JSON Data:** The bulk of the
image contains a string that is intended to represent JSON data. It's an array
of objects, where each object describes a movie. The objects contain key-value
pairs with information like "title", "year", "rating", and "id". * **Movie
entries:** Several movie entries are visible, including titles like "A Serbian
Film", "Sugar Baby", "Madame Web", "The Human Centipede (First Sequence)",
"Knock Knock", "Sunray: Fallen Soldier", "Y2K", "The Idol", "Movie 43", and
"Striptease". 3\. **Error Message:** At the bottom, there is an error message:
"TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'textContent)". This
suggests that whatever system is trying to process this JSON data is
encountering a problem, likely because the data is not valid or in the correct
format. **Important Observations:** * **Possible invalid JSON:** The "JSON
data" isn't correctly formatted. It seems to be a single string containing
JSON-like key-value pairs instead of a properly structured JSON object. There
are likely missing square brackets to encapsulate the entire array of movie
objects, and there may be improper use of commas. * **Inconsistencies:** Some
entries have extra commas (e.g., after the rating). In summary, the image
presents an invalid representation of JSON data, which is causing an error
when processed. The data itself is a collection of movie entries with
attributes like title, year, rating, and ID. ]Screenshot 2025-02-09

I’m assuming it’s occurring because the text formatting for the JSON is
incorrect. Try and put it in the correct format

### Aarsh Sohane (2025-02-09T18:20:37.267Z)

I’ve reloaded a dozen time and even extracted the data again and again to
account for any changes but it still doesn’t work.

could you please add 1 mark to them in the GA (not the overall score)?

  * Please include only those are enrolled this term, obviously.
  * If they didn’t attempt GA4, please include them anyway and give them 1/10.
  * If they got 10/10 already, please add 1 mark anyway and give them 11/10.

Hello [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir,  
As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4
I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can
be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add
that bonus mark to the total kindly.

Hoping for a positive response.  
Thanks & Regards

professor Anand.

if a student has 10/10 and his name is in the bonus list, how would that look
like in the dashboard?

I don’t think it is added in my case.

It will show up as 110 marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this
thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team
with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard
soon.

Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in
their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they
attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to
check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5,
is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right
or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline,
but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any
link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.

### Andrew David (2025-02-24T05:46:12.726Z)

is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the
deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for
learning sake. I understand that each set of students get different questions.
