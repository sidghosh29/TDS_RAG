I missed the end-term exam due to an urgent emergency.

The grading assignment indicates Iâ€™m NOT eligible for a final score. Does that
mean this subject wont be considered at all for the final course card?

Can I still take the end-term exam and be excused from submitting the
assignments and projects?

Yes, I got I grade, I registered for the courses opting for end term only and
not repeating the entire course,

I still got the assignments though, I can complete those, but I am not sure
the new ones will be considered for evaluation, please clarify
