[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Dear TDS Team,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts
related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and
resolution.

### 1\. Graded Assignments (GA)

  * **GA6 Doubts Unresolved:** While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. [(Thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignment-6/169283)

  * **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on [exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev) . However, in GA6, we moved to _Seek_ and in GA7, to _Google Forms_. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.

### 2\. Project Updates

  * **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.
  * **Project 2:** There are multiple doubts posted in the _Project 2_ discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? [(thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/29)

### 3\. ROE Score Update

  * While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.

I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking
forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Lakshay

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image is a close-up photograph of a tiger's face. The tiger
appears to be snarling or roaring, baring its teeth. The intense expression
conveys aggression or anger. **Key Features:** * **Tiger:** The focal point is
the tiger's face. The details are sharp, showing the individual hairs of its
fur. The tiger's coat is orange with black stripes, a characteristic pattern.
* **Mouth and Teeth:** The tiger's mouth is wide open, revealing its sharp
teeth, including prominent canines. The gums are visible as well. * **Eyes:**
The eyes are intense and focused, adding to the overall impression of
aggression. They appear to be a yellowish or golden color. * **Fur:** The
tiger's fur is dense and textured, adding to the animal's powerful presence. *
**Background:** The background is blurred and dark, making the tiger stand
out. It is difficult to distinguish any specific objects or details in the
background. **Text:** * There is a Shutterstock watermark at the bottom of the
image: "Shutterstock.com - 2320794599" **Interpretation:** The image
effectively portrays the power and potential danger of a tiger. The aggressive
expression, combined with the sharp details, creates a strong visual
impact.]tigertds212×148 6.99 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

[@carlton](/u/carlton) It’s been over a month, and now an extra day has been
taken as well—when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is
getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.

The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal.
But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around
to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations
that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to
the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are
able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever
doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are
immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs.
The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors
and the professor as well as operations.

With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets
immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3
set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the
answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were
parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely
cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive
to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have
seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek
portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that
directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.

GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6
was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is
once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek
Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to
our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least
disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.

Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate.
Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB,
we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for
all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough,
you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+
submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all
hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical.
So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations
are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter
with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on
every set back we are facing.

Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it.
Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access
to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we
are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry
dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in
the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship
while its rolling down the slipway.

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall

professional headshot or a close-up taken against a neutral background.
**Subject:** * **Gender:** Male * **Age:** Appears to be in his late 20s to
early 30s. * **Appearance:** * He has a clean-shaven face with a neatly
trimmed mustache and beard stubble. * His hair is dark, short, and well-
groomed. **Clothing:** * He's wearing a dark (likely black or very dark gray)
suit jacket. * Beneath the jacket, he wears a white collared shirt, possibly a
dress shirt. **Background:** * The background is a plain, off-white or light
gray color. There are no distinct patterns or objects visible in the
background. **Facial Features:** * His expression is neutral, perhaps with a
slight smile. * He is looking directly at the camera. **Possible
Interpretations:** Based on the suit and the neutral background, it's likely
that this image is being used for professional purposes such as a LinkedIn
profile, company website, or an official document.] lakshaygarg654:

You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE
in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.

Kind regards

Thank you for your response [@carlton](/u/carlton) and for addressing our
concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth
transition and improving the course experience.

The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to
the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the
course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help
us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.

We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1
results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in
the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the
maximum marks is 100.

Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the
solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project
2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would
be greatly appreciated.  
Looking forward to your response.

Regards,  
Lakshay
