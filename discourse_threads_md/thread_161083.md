## Important Instruction

Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code in Discourse posts. This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: [Extended Syntax | Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks).

A friendly suggestion: kindly go through [Discourse Docs](/c/docs-
discourse/45)! [Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image:
**Content:** The image contains a single element: a yellow smiley face emoji.
**Features:** * **Color:** The face is a bright yellow color. *
**Expression:** It has a simple, friendly expression. The eyes are small,
round black dots, and the mouth is a gentle, curved line suggesting a smile. *
**Shape:** The emoji is circular. * **Style:** It's a typical digital emoji
style with slight shading to give it a subtle 3D appearance. This image is
straightforward and commonly used to express happiness, friendliness, or
positivity.]

[[Image description: The image shows a question related to moving and renaming files in a Unix-like environment. Here's a breakdown: * **Task:** Move and rename files (0.5 marks) * **Download:** Download `q-move-rename-files.zip` and extract it. * **Move:** Use `mv` to move all files from their respective subfolders into an empty folder. * **Rename:** Rename all files, replacing each digit in the filename with the subsequent digit (e.g., `a19b.txt` becomes `a20b.txt`). * **Question:** What is the output of the command: `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` when executed in bash within that folder? The command being asked about performs these steps: 1\. `grep . *`: This searches every file in the current directory for any character (`.`), effectively printing the content of each file along with its filename. 2\. `LC_ALL=C`: Sets the locale to the "C" locale, ensuring consistent sorting regardless of the system's default locale. 3\. `sort`: This sorts the output of `grep` lexicographically. Because of the way `grep` outputs the content, the filenames will be sorted and the contents for each file will be sorted below its name. 4\. `sha256sum`: This calculates the SHA256 checksum of the sorted output. This will provide a single, unique hash value representing the combined content of all the files. In short, the final output will be a sha256 hash of the concatenated sorted content of all files that are present in the directory, based on the grep output. ]image1296×158 7.29 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/8/f8af7c6e2fe001c8bf000605b52c903e1b0e6fe1.png "image")

  
For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with
the next "  
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as  
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt  
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt  
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. [@carlton](/u/carlton)
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or
209 → 210 is not working

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-01-05T05:50:28.537Z)

Hi anant,

Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.

In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

Hi Anant,

**Clarity:** The letter "A" is slightly blurry.] 21f2000370:

> [[Image description: The image shows a programming challenge involving file manipulation in bash. Here's a breakdown: **Task:** * Download the "q-move-rename-files.zip" file and extract its contents. * Move all files from their respective subfolders into a single, empty folder. * Rename the files by replacing each digit in the filename with the next digit. The example given is "a19b.txt" becomes "a20b.txt". **Question:** The main question is what the output of the following bash command will be when executed in the folder containing the renamed files: ```bash grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum ``` Let's break down what each part of the command does: * `grep . *`: This attempts to find any line containing at least one character in any file. The `.` matches any single character, and the `*` specifies "all files". In many cases grep will include the filename prefix with each line, unless being piped. * `LC_ALL=C sort`: This sorts the output of grep lexicographically according to the C locale, this guarantees the sort order regardless of the user's default locale. * `sha256sum`: This calculates the SHA256 checksum of the sorted output. The SHA256 checksum is a cryptographic hash used to verify data integrity. In essence, the question asks what the SHA256 hash of the sorted content of all the files in the folder is, where the content of each file is the first line of the file containing at least one character. ]image1296×158 7.29 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/8/f8af7c6e2fe001c8bf000605b52c903e1b0e6fe1.png "image")

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content:
**General Layout:** * The image is a screenshot of a web page, likely part of
an online assignment or course. * The top of the screen shows browser tabs,
including "Graded Assignment 1", "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Develop", "Latest
Courses/Tools in Dax", and "Beginner's Guide to the Bax". The active tab is
likely the one for the assignment. * A notification bar is present, indicating
a due date ("Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST") and current score ("Score:
8.75/10"). There are also "Check" and "Save" buttons. * On the right, there's
a download menu displaying file names like "q-unicode-data.zip", "README
(1).md", "Book 2 (Sheet1).csv", and "q-move-rename-files.zip" indicating the
files have been downloaded and removed. **Content Area:** * The main content
of the page seems to be related to CSS selectors. * There's a title or heading
that features the word "SELECTORS". * A section provides information about CSS
selectors, referencing the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) as a source of
documentation. The explanation covers: * Basic CSS selectors (element, class,
ID, universal) * Attribute selectors * Combinators (relationship between
elements) * A link is provided to "CSS Diner", described as a game for
learning CSS selectors. * There's a question or task: "Let's make sure you
know how to select elements using CSS selectors. Find all <div>s having a foo

attributes". An attempt has been made to enter "482", but it's marked as
"Incorrect. Try again." **Overall Impression:** The image captures a student
working on a CSS selector assignment, likely as part of a web development
course. The task involves finding elements with specific attributes and
calculating their sum. The student has made an incorrect attempt. ]Screenshot

Hi manmeet,

I don’t know about solution to this.  
Some network setting might be causing problem.

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours
of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and
visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student
developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits
such as cloud resources and domains.

I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces
works very well if you have good internet connection.

2 days ago I attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I
didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.  
When I logged in today it says score is 0.  
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?  
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?

The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It
does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that
they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence
the two stage verification. You still need to [Image description: Here's a

blue button with rounded corners. * **Text:** The button has the word "Save"
written in white font on it. The font appears to be a clean, sans-serif style.
* **Color:** The primary color is a vibrant blue. The text is white, providing
good contrast and making the word easily readable. * **Shape:** The button has
a rectangular shape with rounded corners, a common design element for
interactive elements in user interfaces.] the submissions to get a score for
the GA.

The actual GA questions are on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/> via the seek
portal or  
on the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) introduction page.

Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the
GAs.

As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score.
[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: * **Object:**
The image shows a glossy, stylized check mark. * **Color:** The check mark
itself is white. It is set against a square background that is a bright shade
of green. * **Shape and Style:** The square background has rounded corners and
a glossy, almost three-dimensional appearance, as if it were a button or
sticker. The check mark is simple, with slightly rounded ends. *
**Symbolism:** Check marks are commonly used to indicate agreement,
completion, approval, or selection.]

We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your
browser.  
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted
them, it might have not loaded from our back end server.
[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.

the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked
correctly.**

Your answers on the [exam](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/) site that have
been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying
yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness
question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise
your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in
for the score (until the deadline passes).

are giving same answer still showing wrong. GA1 question  

[[Image description: Here's a description of the image, focusing on the text,
code, and layout: **Overall Impression:** The image shows a programming
problem with a Python solution, along with the output and an attempt to answer
it. The problem is to count the number of Wednesdays within a given date

there are 1349 wednesdays in the date range from august 9, 1986, to june 19,
2012". "incorrect, Try again." **Code Breakdown:** 1\. **Imports:** `from
datetime import date, timedelta` (Imports the necessary classes for date
manipulation.) 2\. **Date Range Definition:** * `start_date = date(1986, 8,
9)` * `end_date = date(2012, 6, 19)` 3\. **Find the First Wednesday:** *
`current_date = start_date` * A `while` loop to increment `current_date` until
it lands on a Wednesday. The code calculates the day of the week using
`.weekday()` (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, ..., 2 for Wednesday).
`current_date += timedelta(days=1)` 4\. **Count Wednesdays:** *
`wednesday_count = 0` * A `while` loop to increment the count of Wednesdays.
`wednesday_count += 1` **Overall Analysis:** * The Python code attempts to
find the first Wednesday in the date range and then iterates, incrementing by
7 days at a time, to count the remaining Wednesdays. * The problem is to find
the total number of Wednesdays between the given start date and end date. *
The submitted answer "1349" is marked as incorrect. Let me know if you want me
to elaborate on any specific part! ]Neutral Minimal Photo Collage Mood Board

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
The same issue is happening in the question 12 of GA1. I have given the answer
by using collab and gemini , its giving the proper result but showing wrong.  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Layout:** The image is divided into two main sections: 1\. **Left Side:**
Shows a text editor with Python code. The code is dark-themed, typical of
programming IDEs or text editors. 2\. **Right Side:** Features a video
screenshot or embedded video about "COMPUTER STUFF THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU,"
specifically related to "Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8, and
the BOM". Below the video is some descriptive text and a calculated sum.
**Detailed Code Breakdown (Left Side):** The Python code appears to be
processing data from CSV and potentially TXT files. Here's a breakdown of what
can be inferred: * **Reading Files:** The code attempts to read CSV files
(`csv_file_1_path`, `csv_file_2_path`) and a TXT file (`txt_file_path`). It
tries to automatically detect the encoding of these files to handle different
character sets. Error handling (using `try...except` blocks) is present to
catch `FileNotFoundError` and `UnicodeDecodeError`. * **Data Extraction:** The
code concatenates the contents of all files into a single string
(`all_content`). It then splits this string into lines. * **Value
Processing:** The code iterates through each line, attempting to split it into
a symbol and a value using the `split(",")` function. It removes
leading/trailing spaces from both the symbol and value. * **Criteria
Matching:** A check is performed to see if the symbol matches certain criteria
(possibly variations of target symbols). * **Summation:** If the symbol
matches, the code attempts to convert the value to a number and adds it to a
running total (`total_sum`). Error handling is present to ignore lines with
incorrect formatting or non-numeric values. * **Output:** The final sum
(`total_sum`) is printed, along with a message indicating what it represents
(the sum of all values associated with specified symbols). * **User Input:**
The code is likely prompting the user to enter the paths to the three files
(two CSV files and one TXT file). * **Example Output:** "The sum of all values
associated with the specified symbols is: 31512.0" **Video Information (Right
Side):** * The video is part of a series or lesson about character encoding,
which is a crucial aspect of data processing, especially when dealing with
text files from different sources or regions. **Overall Context:** The image
appears to show a programmer working on a data processing task. The task
involves reading data from multiple files (CSV and TXT), handling potential
encoding issues, extracting relevant values based on certain symbols, and
calculating a sum. The video on the side is likely providing a theoretical or
educational background on the encoding aspects of the task. ]Minimal Square

Hi Shouvik,

Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your
answer in input box.

Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses
difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

Also have a look at what `all_content` variable contains, see if there are

Hi Jivraj,

I have tried with a different browser, but still not working. Below is the
screenshot for your reference.  

[[Image description: The image shows a dark grey screen displaying an error
message indicating an interrupted internet connection. In the top left corner,
there's an image of a disconnected plug with a cartoonish design. The text on
the screen reads: "Your connection was interrupted" "A network change was
detected." "ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED" Below the text, there's a blue button labeled
"Refresh". This suggests the user can try to reload the page and re-establish
the connection. The overall impression is a standard error screen when a
computer or device loses its internet connection. ]Screenshot 2025-01-13

[@Samra](/u/samra) this is almost certainly due to a (typically corporate)

(I face this problem at office often. Once, our company’s firewall blocked our

Oh, good catch, [@23f2000237](/u/23f2000237) and
[@siva.bhaskaran](/u/siva.bhaskaran) \- I made a mistake in the evaluation
script. It included the `span`.

I fixed it. Note: None of the earlier answers are affected, i.e. if you got it
right earlier, it’ll stay right.

In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install
them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computer’s RAM etc.,  
In one of the classes, you said that there is something - colab like cloud

please let me know how to go about it ??

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on
its textual content and layout: **Overall Layout:** The image is a screenshot
of a terminal window, specifically a PowerShell terminal. The background is
dark blue. The prompt in the terminal indicates the user is logged in as
"kaiff" and working in the directory "C:\Users\kaiff". The image shows a
series of commands being executed in the terminal and their corresponding
output. **Commands and Output:** 1\. **First Command:** `Get-FileHash -Path
formatted.md -Algorithm SHA256` * This command calculates the SHA256 hash of
the file "formatted.md". * The output shows the algorithm (SHA256), the
calculated hash value, and the file path: * Algorithm: SHA256 * Hash:
216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175 * Path:
C:\Users\kaiff\formatted.md 2\. **Second Command:** `npx -y prettier@3.4.2
"F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level\TERM 2\TDS\README.md" > formatted.md` * This
command uses `prettier` (a code formatter) to format the contents of the file
"F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level\TERM 2\TDS\README.md" and save the formatted
output to "formatted.md". * The `>` redirector sends the output from prettier
to the formatted.md file, likely overwriting its existing content. 3\. **Third
Command:** `Get-FileHash -Path formatted.md -Algorithm SHA256` * This repeats
the first command to calculate the SHA256 hash of "formatted.md" again, after
it has been overwritten with the formatted content. * The output shows the
algorithm (SHA256), the calculated hash value, and the file path. Note that
the hash value is now different, indicating the file content has changed. *
Algorithm: SHA256 * Hash:
216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175 * Path:
C:\Users\kaiff\formatted.md 4\. **Fourth Command:** `npx -y prettier@3.4.2
"F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level\TERM 2\TDS\README.md" > formatted.md` * This
repeats the second command. 5\. **Fifth Command:** `certutil -hashfile
formatted.md SHA256` * This is an alternative method of calculating the hash
using certutil. *The output confirms the hash calculation and reports
successful completion. **Key Observations:** * The user is likely comparing
the SHA256 hash of "formatted.md" before and after formatting it using
`prettier`. * The initial and final hash values are the same. * The
"README.md" file in the specified directory is being used to update the
"formatted.md" file. In summary, the image shows a sequence of commands to
format a markdown file using "prettier" and then verify its SHA256 hash using
two different approaches. ]Screenshot 2025-01-18 1543211317×630 30.9

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on the text and relevant features: **Overall Layout:** The image is a screenshot of a screen displaying questions or tasks, likely from an online assignment or assessment platform. There's a header area at the top, followed by a section showing "Recent saves," and then the main content: a list of questions. **Header:** * **Time/Connectivity:** "7:15 PM | 0.8KB/s" - indicates the current time and network status. * **Due Date:** "Due Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" - shows the deadline for the assignment. * **"Score" Button:** A button labeled "Score" is present, likely to view the current score. **Recent Saves Section:** * The section is titled "Recent saves." * It shows a history of saves with details like date, time, and score (which is currently 0 for all listed saves). Each save has a "Reload" button next to it. * The entries are formatted as "Reload from DD/MM/YYYY, HH:MM:SS. Score: 0". For example: "Reload from 19/01/2025, 16:22:36. Score: 0" **Questions Section:** * The section is titled "Questions." * It's a numbered list of tasks or questions, each with an associated point value (marks). The format is "Number. Question Text (Points)". * Examples: * "1. VS Code Version (0.25 marks)" * "2. Make HTTP requests with uv (1 mark)" * "3. Run command with npx (0.5 marks)" * "4. Use Google Sheets (0.25 marks)" * "5. Use Excel (0.25 marks)" * "6. Use DevTools (0.5 marks)" * "7. Count Wednesdays (0.5 marks)" * "8. Extract CSV from a ZIP (0.25 marks)" * "9. Use JSON (0.75 marks)" * "10. Multi-cursor edits to convert to JSON (0.5 marks)" * "11. CSS selectors (0.5 marks)" * "12. Process files with different encodings (1 mark)" * "13. Use GitHub (0.5 marks)" * "14. Replace across files (0.75 marks)" * "15. List files and attributes (0.75 marks)" * "16. Move and rename files (0.5 marks)" * "17. Compare files (0.5 marks)" **Specific Observations:** * The questions seem to be related to programming, data manipulation, and file handling. * Several questions involve specific tools or libraries (e.g., VS Code, npx, Google Sheets, DevTools, JSON, CSS selectors, GitHub). * The point values vary from 0.25 marks to 1 mark, suggesting different levels of complexity or importance. ]Screenshot_2025-01-19-19-15-29-055_com.android.chrome1080×2400 172 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/5/954ce1ef1cc6d0d6de0f540ac0215c8b45099527.jpeg "Screenshot_2025-01-19-19-15-29-055_com.android.chrome")

If you are on windows, you might not be able to use sha256sum.

Here are two disussions that might help you out.

[@Rohitkumar7463](/u/rohitkumar7463) [@23f2003845](/u/23f2003845)

If you are on Windows Powershell  
Then instead of `sha256sum` you can simply use `Get-FileHash`

Send the output of the `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md` to a text file eg.
`output.txt` and then use `Get-FileHash` on powershell with the `output.txt`
and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.  
You might be able to pipe the data directly to `Get-FileHash` but I have not
tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

Kind regards

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir

as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based
on errors other students point out.

I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I
get 10/10.

Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see
right now will be set in stone?

If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can
reduce my marks.

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall
Structure:** * The image seems to be a screenshot of a user interface,
possibly from a mobile app or web page. It's divided into a header and a body.
**Header (Top Section):** * **Date and Time:** "6 Jan 2025 at 11:59 PM IST".
This indicates a timestamp. * **Score:** "Score: 10 / 10". This likely
indicates a score or performance metric. **Body (Bottom Section):** *
**Heading:** "Recent saves" * **List of Saves:** * "Reload from 20/1/2025,
6:05:24 PM. Score: 10": This seems to be a list item indicating a saved state.
There is a reload button beside it. The item includes the date, time and the
score. **Key Features & Observations:** * The "Reload" button suggests the
possibility of restoring a previous state or game progress. * The consistent
presence of a "Score" indicates some sort of evaluation or achievement
tracking. * The "Recent Saves" heading implies there may be more than one save
state available.]image742×336 21.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

[@iamsarthak](/u/iamsarthak) – as long as you don’t save again, your score
will stay 10, even if I modify the evaluation script [Image description:
Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the image you sent: **Content:**
The image features a single object: a yellow smiling face emoji. **Features:**
* **Color:** The face is a bright, standard yellow. * **Expression:** The
emoji displays a simple, happy expression. It has two small, dark eyes and a
gently curved, smiling mouth. * **Shape:** The face is perfectly circular. *
**Texture:** There's a subtle gradient effect suggesting some soft shading or
lighting. This gives a slightly three-dimensional look to the face. *
**Background:** The background is solid black. This helps the bright yellow
emoji stand out prominently. * **Pixelation:** The image seems to be of
relatively low resolution as pixelation can be observed. **Potential Use
Cases:** This image could be used to: * Indicate positivity or happiness. *
React to a message or statement in a lighthearted manner. * Represent a
general feeling of well-being. * Serve as a placeholder image for a profile.]

We don’t re-evaluate previous results in the graded assignments.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,

Question 15 is under the section for linux

I got the file which needs to be processed to answer the question

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: The image is
a screenshot of what appears to be a terminal output, showing a list of files
and their associated details. The data is presented in a tabular format with
the following columns: * **Length:** Numerical values representing the size or
length of the files. * **Date:** Dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD. * **Time:**
Times in the format HH:MM. * **Name:** File names, all with the extension
".txt". Here's a breakdown of the data: * **File 1:** * Length: 4094 * Date:
2004-03-10 * Time: 07:49 * Name: file0.txt * **File 2:** * Length: 8410 *
Date: 2007-02-11 * Time: 18:46 * Name: file1.txt * **File 3:** * Length: 8062
* Date: 2000-01-26 * Time: 13:40 * Name: file2.txt * **File 4:** * Length:
9748 * Date: 2010-09-27 * Time: 00:34 * Name: file3.txt The text is displayed
in a monospaced font, typical of terminal outputs, and the background is dark,
with the text being in a lighter color (likely white or a light green/gray).

I can solve this now using pandas.

From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use
something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?

### Anand S (2025-01-20T13:22:56.326Z)

[@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573) You can solve it with any tool you’re comfortable
with, including pandas.

But since you _already_ know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore
how to do it with something like `awk` (or any other tool) to get a broader
exposure into different approaches.

### Rohit Kumar  (2025-01-20T15:16:02.988Z)

[[Image description: The image shows a screenshot of a PowerShell terminal on
a Windows computer. Here's a breakdown of the visible content: **Top
Section:** * **Title Bar/Header:** Partially visible, it mentions "Try the new
cross-platform PowerShell" and includes a URL: "https://aka.ms/pscore6". *
**Commands and Errors:** * `PS C:\Users\HP> cd downloads`: The user attempts
to change the directory to "downloads". This appears to be successful. * `PS
C:\Users\HP\downloads> cd Downloads`: The user then tries to change the
directory to "Downloads" (note the capitalization). * **Error Message:** A red
error message appears indicating that the path
'C:\Users\HP\downloads\Downloads' does not exist. The error specifies
"ObjectNotFound" and the `FullyQualifiedErrorId` as
`PathNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SetLocationCommand`. This tells us
that PowerShell's `Set-Location` command (which `cd` is an alias for) couldn't
find the specified directory. **Middle Section:** * `PS C:\Users\HP\downloads>
npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md >output.txt`: The user runs the `npx` command
to execute the `prettier` package (version 3.4.2). `prettier` is a code
formatter. The command takes `README.md` as input and redirects the formatted
output to a file named `output.txt`. The `-y` flag likely automatically
confirms any prompts during the `npx` execution. * `PS C:\Users\HP\downloads>
Get-FileHash .\output.txt`: The user runs the `Get-FileHash` command to
calculate the hash of the newly created `output.txt` file. * **Output of Get-
FileHash:** * Algorithm: SHA256 * Hash:
7EA1921D69EAA2FDA9F6B5143A291C894CDC59E6CF6DBAA9EC8FF04449A8F7E5 * Path:
C:\Users\HP **Bottom Section:** * `PS C:\Users\HP\downloads>`: Shows the
current directory, which is `C:\Users\HP\downloads`. * `>> Algorithm` * `>>
SHA256` * **Output of Get-FileHash:** * Algorithm: SHA256 * Hash:
7EA1921D69EAA2FDA9F6B5143A291C894CDC59E6CF6DBAA9EC8FF04449A8F7E5 * Path:
C:\Users\HP **Key Observations:** * The user is working in the PowerShell
terminal. * The user attempts to change directories, but encounters an error
due to incorrect capitalization. * The user uses `npx` to format a `README.md`
file and save the output to `output.txt`. * The user calculates the SHA256
hash of `output.txt` using `Get-FileHash`. The file path from this command
also appears incorrect as the Path shows C:\Users\HP which is not the intended
output for this command. * The hash calculation is performed twice, likely due
to an issue where the full output of the command was not shown properly the
first time. In summary, the image captures a sequence of PowerShell commands,
including directory changes, using a code formatter, and calculating file
hashes. It also reveals an error related to capitalization and file paths when
changing directories.]20250120_2039501920×1440 168

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-01-21T04:01:30.251Z)

[@Rohitkumar7463](/u/rohitkumar7463) The hash code is exactly what you see
under the column Hash,

7E…E5

Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt

A Hash is a _nearly_ unique representation of some data within some range
dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of
data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure
you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

### Parmeet Singh (2025-01-21T09:57:52.249Z)

**Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question**

quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143
bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically
in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to
expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time
accordingly.  
I got the correct answer once i localized the files timestamp to IST.

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Content:**
The image features a single, white letter "L" against a soft, muted blue
background. **Details:** * **Letter "L":** The letter "L" is rendered in a
simple, sans-serif font. It appears slightly three-dimensional, possibly with
a subtle shadow effect that gives it a raised or embossed look. The color is a
clean, bright white. * **Background:** The background is a solid, muted blue
color. The shade of blue is soft and unsaturated, lending a calm and gentle
aesthetic to the overall image. * **Overall Impression:** The image is clean,
simple, and minimalist. The focus is clearly on the letter "L," with the
background serving as a neutral backdrop.] 22f2001175:

Hi Saravanan,

I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name
`Bob`, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required
sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique,
the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.

We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not
acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the
script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the
solution.

kind regards

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on
text, objects, and other relevant features: **Overall Layout:** The image is a
screenshot of a webpage, likely related to a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
validator or parser. The layout includes: * **Title:** "JSON Hash" in large,
bold text. * **Text Area:** A large text area containing what appears to be a
long, seemingly random string. The string looks like a series of key-value
pairs separated by colons. The format is inconsistent, and it's clearly not
valid JSON. * **Button:** A green button labeled "Hash". This likely triggers
some action (like validating or generating a hash based on the content in the
text area). * **Error Message:** A red box displays an error message: "Error:
Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)". This
confirms that the content in the text area is being interpreted as JSON, and
it's not valid. **Detailed Content:** * **JSON Hash (Title):** Indicates the
purpose of the page is related to processing a JSON string and possibly
creating a hash value from it. * **Text Area Content (This is important, so
I'll transcribe the broken JSON):** ``` JUTAING: RSIVE : M: 109SMA, C:

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image's content,
focusing on elements relevant to answering questions: **Overall Layout:** *
The image presents a web interface, likely part of an educational or
interactive platform. * It's dark themed, common for coding-related
environments. * It seems to be an instruction or challenge related to using
Visual Studio Code (VS Code). **Text Content:** * **Title:** "AI Editors:
Copilot, Cursor" This indicates the topic of the section is about AI-powered
coding tools like Copilot and Cursor (and likely other such tools). *
**Note:** "AI Editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help
you write code faster." This gives context about what these tools are and
their purpose. * **Statement:** "These are built on top of VS Code. These are
now a standard tool in every developer's toolkit. Please use them." -
Reinforces that VS Code is the foundation, and these AI tools are useful for
developers. * **Instructions:** "Install and run Visual Studio Code. In your
Terminal (or Command Prompt), type `code -s` and press Enter. Copy and paste
the entire output below." This is the core instruction of the challenge. *
**Question:** "What is the output of `code -s`?" This is the challenge
presented to the user. * **Feedback:** "Incorrect. Try again." This indicates
that the user has submitted an answer, but it was wrong. **Interactive
Elements:** * **Input Box:** There's a large, rectangular input box where the
user is expected to type their answer. This box is currently empty. * **Error
Indicator:** There's a small error icon (likely an exclamation point) within
the input box. The input box itself is highlighted in a red/maroon color,
further indicating that the previous answer was incorrect. **Key Takeaways:**
* The task involves running the command `code -s` in a terminal after
installing VS Code. * The user needs to provide the *output* of this command
in the given input box. * The system checks the user's input and provides
feedback (correct/incorrect). * The current state suggests that the user has
made at least one unsuccessful attempt. In essence, the image shows a coding
challenge where the user has to execute a specific VS Code command (`code -s`)
and provide the resulting output. The negative feedback suggests that the
user's previous submission was not the expected output. ]image1590×466 29.3

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content: The
image is a screenshot of a webpage or online learning platform that appears to
be related to software package management and potentially, Python programming.
**Top Section:** * There's a picture featuring a person pointing towards the
left side of the image. * To the left of the person, there's a visual with the
text "uv" in a stylized font. There is also the Python logo. * Above the "uv"
visual, there's text "package/project manager". **Lower Section
(Code/Output/Instructions):** * The content suggests the image is from a
coding tutorial or exercise. * There's a line of code: "Running uv run --with
httpie -- https [URL] installs the Python package httpie and sends a HTTPS
request to the URL.". This line seems to be demonstrating the use of a tool
called "uv" with the "httpie" package. * The next sentence provides context:
"Send a HTTPS request to https://httpbin.org/get with the URL encoded
parameter email set to 23f2000098@ds.study.iitm.ac.in". This is about sending
an HTTP request to a specific URL and including an email address as a URL
parameter. * A question is posed: "What is the JSON output of the command?
(Paste only the JSON body, not the headers)". This indicates the task is to
identify the JSON output resulting from the prior commands. * The user's
attempted answer is provided as a JSON string:
"{'args':['email:23f2000098@ds.study.iitm.ac.in'),
"origin":"106.197.103.245','url':'https://httpbin.org/get?email=23f2000098%40ds.study.iitm.ac.in')".
* Finally, an error message is shown: "SyntaxError: Expected property name or
'' in JSON at position 1 (line 1 column 2)". This indicates the provided JSON
is invalid, likely due to syntax errors. The error specifically points to an
issue near the beginning of the JSON. **Overall Impression:** The image shows
a coding tutorial about using "uv" to install "httpie" and make an HTTPS
request. The task is to determine the correct JSON output from that request,
and the user's attempt resulted in a syntax error. ]image1613×702 193

### Saravanan (2025-01-25T22:26:09.529Z)

I tried this. For me still the answer is incorrect.

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content: The
image is a screenshot of a command-line interface (likely PowerShell on a
Windows system) showing a series of commands and their outputs. **Commands and
Outputs:** 1\. **`PS C:\Users\sarva> cd downloads`**: This command changes the
current directory to the "downloads" folder within the "sarva" user directory.
2\. **`PS C:\Users\sarva\downloads> certutil -hashfile
C:\Users\sarva\downloads\README.md SHA256`**: This command uses the `certutil`
utility to calculate the SHA256 hash of the "README.md" file located in the
"downloads" folder. * The output shows the SHA256 hash:
`eef23369e30d7bd99173ef4988c65a59b80bf56f60da4c9ab95c1903be312317` * The
message "CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully." indicates the
command executed without errors. 3\. **`PS C:\Users\sarva\downloads> npx -y
prettier@3.4.2 README.md > output.txt`**: This command uses `npx` to run the
`prettier` formatter (version 3.4.2) on the "README.md" file and redirects the
output to a new file called "output.txt". 4\. **`PS C:\Users\sarva\downloads>
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 output.txt`**: This command uses the `Get-
FileHash` cmdlet (PowerShell command) to calculate the SHA256 hash of the
"output.txt" file. * The output is formatted as a table: * **Algorithm:**
SHA256 * **Hash:**
`CECFD0A2DC971DE14A28CABF98ED854A9E6C7A94BD788AB0D10F5D991A4FA054` * **Path:**
`C:\Users\sarva\downloads\outp...` (The full path is truncated, but it points
to the "output.txt" file in the "downloads" folder). **Overall
Interpretation:** The sequence of commands suggests that the user is trying
to: 1\. Calculate the initial SHA256 hash of the "README.md" file. 2\. Format
the "README.md" file using the `prettier` code formatter, saving the formatted
output to "output.txt". 3\. Calculate the SHA256 hash of the formatted
"output.txt" file. The commands are likely being used to compare the hash of
the original "README.md" file with the hash of the formatted version, likely
to confirm the file was not changed (other than formatting changes).

Finally. Got the correct one in bit dash.

[Image description: The image shows a terminal window, likely from a macOS or Linux system. The current user is "sarva" on the host "SURIYA", running the "MINGW64" shell. The current working directory is "~/downloads". The command executed is: `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum` This command uses `npx` to run the `prettier` tool at version 3.4.2. The tool is applied to the file `README.md`. The standard output of `prettier` is piped to the `sha256sum` command, which calculates the SHA256 hash of the formatted `README.md` file. The output of `sha256sum` is: `2ccd877ded5f031c251d3319bc1b266018635156db88e63105943dbef7e106a1 *-` This is the SHA256 hash of the processed README.md file.

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on the
details relevant to answering questions about it: **Overall Content:** The
image shows a coding challenge or question presented in a text-based format.
It involves downloading a zip file, extracting it, and then analyzing the
files within based on their size and modification date. The user has submitted
an answer, which was incorrect. **Key Elements:** * **Text:** *
**Instructions:** "Download `q-list-files-attributes.zip` and extract it. Use
`ls` with options to list all files in the folder along with their date and
file size." This tells the user to download a file and extract its contents.
The `ls` command suggests a Linux/Unix environment is expected. *
**Question:** "What's the total size of all files at least 2404 bytes large
and modified on or after Mon, 18 Mar, 2002, 1:02 am IST?" This is the core
question that needs to be answered by analyzing the extracted files. *
**Incorrect Answer:** "485969" This is the user's attempt at answering the
question, which was marked as incorrect. * **Warning:** "Don't copy from
inside the ZIP file or use Windows Explorer to unzip. That destroys the
timestamps. Extract using unzip, 7-Zip or similar utilities and check the
timestamps." This warns against improper extraction methods that can alter
file timestamps, emphasizing that timestamps are critical for getting the
correct answer. * **Visual Cues:** * **The file name** `q-list-files-
attributes.zip` is highlighted. * **"Incorrect. Try again."** message
indicating the submitted answer was wrong. **Inference:** The challenge
requires downloading and extracting a zip file, and using command-line tools
(`ls` or similar) to examine the file attributes. It specifically requires the
user to accurately consider file timestamps when calculating the total size of
files meeting the size and date criteria. Standard "copy/paste" methods of
extracting a zip file alter the timestamp, so the user must employ methods
that preserve them.]image846×347 28.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

Elements:** * **Problem Description:** The text describes the "tickets" table
and the desired outcome: "What is the total sales of all the items in the
"Gold" ticket type? Write SQL to calculate it." It specifies to ignore case
and misspellings. * **Table Snippet:** A small sample of the table data is
provided, showing values for the "type", "units", and "price" columns for
several rows (Silver, gold, BRONZE). * **Proposed SQL Query:** The user has
written the following SQL query: ```sql select sum(units*price) from tickets
where type='gold' collate nocase; ``` * **Error Message:** An error message is
displayed indicating that the expected output [[124944.59]] has not been

"Multi-cursor edits to convert to JSON (0.5 marks)" - indicating the
question's subject and point value. * **Instructions:** * Download a file
named "q-multi-cursor-json.txt". * Use "multi-cursors" (likely referring to a
text editing technique) to manipulate the file's content. * Convert the
content into a single JSON object. * Specify that key-value pairs should be
transformed into the format (key: value, key: value, ...). * **Verification
Step:** * Paste the resulting JSON into a tool at the URL "tools-in-data-
science.pages.dev/jsonhash". * Click the "Hash" button on the tool. *
**Response Area:** * A text box displaying the incorrect hash value:
"c0b9426a7f358720f193d3806497ec0d81d10d835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536". * An error
message: "Incorrect. Try again." **Overall:** The image is a screenshot of a
coding assignment or quiz question. The task requires the student to download
a file, use a multi-cursor editing technique to format it into JSON, and then
use an external tool to generate a hash of the JSON as verification. The
displayed hash value is incorrect, prompting the user to retry.]image1635×317

Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2:
value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and
after every key-value pair put a comma.

### Tanya kamboj (2025-01-25T16:02:51.992Z)

i am doing so only … i can send u the example -  
{ “0”: “wEfsmtde”,  
“83”: “NghqzO3DL”,  
“NqN7EcM”: “I”,  
“vFD2C”: “KAB”}  
i am not able to find what’s the mistake


---
### Saransh Saini (2025-01-25T16:44:17.023Z)

Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem
then these are the few reasons I can think of

  1. Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
  2. Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.


---
### Tanya kamboj (2025-01-25T17:09:51.432Z)

Okay, i will go through my json object once.  
And for hash code i am using chrome only

### Tanya kamboj (2025-01-26T07:29:05.341Z)

It worked.  
Thank you

**Overall Layout:** The image appears to be a screenshot of an online
assignment or quiz page. The background is dark. **Textual Elements:** *
**Header:** "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" indicates the due date
and time of the assignment. * **Title:** "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development
To..." This likely refers to the name of the course/assignment. *
**Instructions:** A list of instructions is provided. Key points include: *
Reading material is provided. * Answers can be checked by pressing a "Check"
button. * Saving can be done with a "Save" button. * Reloading is permitted. *
Browser compatibility issues are possible. * Any resources (Internet, ChatGPT,
friends, libraries, frameworks) can be used. * It is possible to hack the code
for the quiz. * **Question:** "Should you take TDS this term?" Followed by: *
"If this assignment takes you under 2 hours to complete, you will likely do OK
in TDS." * "If you score above 8 / 10, you might get an S or A grade, with
effort and luck." * **Buttons:** Visually shows buttons with "Check" and

instructions are quite liberal, allowing the use of any resources. The image
also provides guidance on whether to take the TDS term based on the estimated
difficulty and score on the assignment. ]image1359×878 78.5

Dear Sai,

This is NOT the picture of your dashboard.

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image is a headshot of a young man, likely a photograph
taken for identification or personal use. **Subject:** * A young man with dark
hair styled into a short, textured, and slightly messy look. The hair appears
thick and well-groomed. * He has dark eyebrows and eyes, and a visible
mustache. * His skin tone appears to be medium. **Clothing:** * He's wearing a
white collared shirt or top. The collar is partially visible. **Background:**
* The background is plain white. This suggests it was taken in a studio
setting or with a backdrop. **Facial Expression:** * He appears to have a
slight smile or a neutral expression. **Other Features:** * The lighting seems
even, indicating a controlled lighting setup. * The image appears to be a
digital photograph. In summary, this is a straightforward headshot of a young
man against a white background. There is no text or other objects of interest
within the scene.] 22f3001740:

### Shashank Tripathi (2025-02-19T09:23:01.247Z)

Hello Sir,  
I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding
my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.

I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of **80 out of
100**. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as
“**absent** ” for this particular assignment.

I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to
accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look
into this matter and update my grade accordingly?  

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Layout and Context:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage,
specifically related to an online exam or assessment. The URL in the address
bar suggests it's hosted on a site named "exam.sanand.workers.dev" and is part
of a project or course labeled "tds-2025-01-ga1." The overall aesthetic of the
page uses a dark theme. **Key Elements and Sections:** * **Header/Notification
Area:** At the top, there's a prominent message stating "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan,
2025, 11:59 pm IST." This indicates the exam or assessment has concluded.
There's also "Score: 0", along with "Check all" and "Save" buttons. *
**Discussion Invitation:** Just below that is a blue-green rectangular section
with a speech bubble icon. The text reads, "Have questions? Join the
discussion on Discourse." * **User Information:** Below the discussion
invitation, the text "You are logged in as 23f3001601@ds.study.iitm.ac.in."
indicates the user's login status and the associated email address, which
seems to be connected to "ds.study.iitm.ac.in" (likely an educational
institution). There is a "Logout" button below this. * **Recent Saves:** This
section provides a history of saved progress. It's titled "Recent saves (most
recent is your official score)". There are multiple entries that show the time
and date of the saves, along with a "Score: 8" for each save. There are reload
buttons associated with each save. For instance, there is a save from
"1/27/2025, 12:00:05 AM. Score: 8", and two saves from "1/26/2025, 11:59:55
PM. Score: 8". **Specific details** * The latest save, from the 27th, shows a
score of 8. **In Summary:** The image is from a post-exam interface where the
user can see their login status, the exam end time, saved progress, and is
invited to join a discussion forum. The exam appears to have ended, but the
user can review their saved attempts. ]Screenshot 2025-02-18 191335881×835

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: The image
features a title card for a course or presentation. The background is a dark
maroon color, overlaid with a pattern of small, uniformly spaced circles,
giving a subtle dotted texture. There's a darker maroon gradient or shape on
the left side of the image. **Text present includes:** * "Tools in Data" -
positioned at the top of the image. * "Science" - beneath "Tools in Data" *
"NEW COURSE" - slightly below and to the left of "Science". * "Week 1
Assignment - Absent" - positioned at the bottom of the image. The text is all
in white and appears to be in a sans-serif font for the main title. The
content suggests it's either an advertisement for a new course or a course
module available online, likely related to data science. The "Week 1
Assignment - Absent" indicates a specific assignment within that course,
likely with a status indicating it has not been completed.]Screenshot
