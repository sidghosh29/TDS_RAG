Connect to the GitHub API- it lets you fetch user data automatically(go to
github developer settings ->personal acceess tokens->tokens(classic)  
Search for Users with criteria mentioned in your question  
We organize the list from newest to oldest, making it easy to spot the
freshest account.

Sir I am having trouble in q8 also whenever I am pushing commit in git hub it
was showing in GitHub repository but it is not working in git hub actions.  

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall
Impression:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a laptop screen
displaying a GitHub repository's "Actions" tab. The user is likely viewing
workflow runs. **Key Elements and Text:** * **GitHub Navigation Bar:** * The
address bar shows the URL: `github.com/Sakshi6749/my-repo/actions` indicating
the user "Sakshi6749" is viewing the "actions" page of a repository named "my-
repo" on GitHub. * GitHub main navigation: "Code", "Issues", "Pull requests",
"Actions" (selected), "Projects", "Wiki", "Security", "Insights", "Settings".
* "All Bookmarks" is visible on the top right. * **"Actions" Tab Content:** *
**Left Sidebar:** * "Actions" heading * "All workflows" (selected) * "Daily
Commit" workflow * "Management" section with links to "Caches",
"Attestations", "Runners", "Usage metrics", and "Performance metrics." *
**Main Content Area:** * "All workflows" heading. * "Showing runs from all
workflows" text. * "Filter workflow runs" search bar. * A table or list of
workflow runs. * Headers: "Event", "Status", "Branch", "Actor." * **Workflow
Run Details (3 visible):** * "second time": * "Daily Commit #3: Commit 7715436
pushed by Sakshi6749" * Branch: "main" * "33 minutes ago" * "Daily Commit": *
"Daily Commit #2: Manually run by Sakshi6749" * Branch: "main" * "4 hours ago"
* "Daily Commit": * "Daily Commit #1: Manually run by Sakshi6749" * Branch:
"main" * "4 hours ago" * **Laptop Details:** * The laptop is an ASUS Zenbook.
* The keyboard is visible. * The Windows taskbar is present. * The date and
time are visible: "23:45 09-02-2025" * The weather is 14°C and Haze.
**Inferences:** * The user "Sakshi6749" is likely a developer or working on a
GitHub project. * The "Daily Commit" workflow seems to be configured for the
repository. * Workflow runs seem to have failed ("x" icons on the left of all
workflows). Let me know if you would like me to focus on any specific part of
the image! ]173912467233449595293011525167201920×1440 174
