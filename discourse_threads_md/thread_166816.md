[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Layout:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a web page, possibly an
online learning platform. It is divided into distinct sections. **Top
Section:** * **Red Banner:** A red banner at the top indicates the deadline
"Ended at Sun, 9 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST." It also displays "Score: 0" along
with "Check all" and "Save" buttons. **Middle Section:** * **Bonus Marks
Notice:** There's a message "Bonus marks for posting on Discourse," indicating
an incentive for students to participate in online discussions. * The notice
specifies that IITM BS students who reply to the discussion on "GA4 - Data
Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" with relevant questions or
replies will get a bonus mark. * **Login Information:** It states "You are
logged in as 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." and a "Logout" button. *
**Handwritten Text:** In the middle of the screen, there is handwritten text
saying "week 4". **Bottom Section:** * **Recent Saves:** A section labeled
"Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" displays a history of
scores: * "Reload from 9/2/2025, 8:04:05 pm. Score: 8" * "Reload from
9/2/2025, 8:03:25 pm. Score: 8" * "Reload from 9/2/2025, 4:03:58 pm. Score: 4"
**Key Features:** * **Educational Context:** The image clearly pertains to an
educational setting, likely involving online coursework and graded
assignments. * **Bonus Point System:** The mention of bonus marks indicates a
system to encourage student engagement. * **Login and Score Tracking:** The
login information and score history suggest a personalized learning
environment. * **IITM BS Context:** The mention of "IITM BS" suggests the
course is associated with the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM),
Bachelor of Science program. * **Date/Time Information:** The dates and times
are all in February 2025. In essence, the image captures a snapshot of a
student's progress or activity on an online learning platform, with a focus on
bonus opportunities and score tracking within the context of an IITM BS
course. ]image1035×481 38.9 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Structure:** The image shows a course card or preview tile, likely
for an online learning platform. It is divided into three main sections: *
**Top Section (Dark Background):** This contains the course title and a brief
descriptor. * **Middle Section (Light Background):** This includes information
about assignments. * **Bottom Section (Button):** This is a button or link
leading to the main course page. **Textual Elements:** * **Course Title:**
"Tools in Data Science" is prominently displayed, indicating the subject
matter of the course. * **Descriptor:** "NEW COURSE" suggests that this is a
newly added or recently released course. * **Assignment Information:** "Week 1
Assignment - 87.50" shows a specific assignment and a score or grade. * **Call
to Action:** "Go to Course page >" is the text on a button encouraging users
to navigate to the full course content. **Visual Features:** * **Color
Palette:** The image uses a combination of dark maroon/brown (top section
background), light gray/white (middle and bottom sections), and white/light
text. * **Background Pattern:** The dark background of the top section appears
to have a subtle pattern of dots. **In summary, the image is a promotional or
informational card for a "Tools in Data Science" course. It highlights that it
is a new course, shows assignment progress (87.50), and includes a call to
action to visit the course page.**]image463×457 26.9

[@24ds3000061](/u/24ds3000061) [@22f2001532](/u/22f2001532)

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the
scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual
(i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be
made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

### Revi (2025-02-12T05:32:48.000Z)

Thanks Carlton. Now the results are visible in the dashboard.

Thanks

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir in my case, in week 2 it is showing “Absent” but I
have attempted and saved the answers  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout and Structure:** The image appears to be a section from a web
page or application, most likely related to an educational platform. It
displays information about courses the user is currently enrolled in. **Text
Elements:** * **"My Current Courses"**: This is the main heading, indicating
the section's purpose. * **"Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) till this
ter"**: This is a sub heading related to CGPA * **"Project Cumulative Grade
Point Average (Project Co"**: This is a sub heading related to Project CGPA *
**"Tools in Data Science"**: This is the title of a specific course. *
**"REPEAT FULL COURSE"**: This text likely indicates the user is repeating the
course. * **"Week 1 Assignment - 57.50"**: This shows the score for the Week 1
assignment. * **"Week 2 Assignment - Absent"**: This shows the status of the
Week 2 assignment. * **"Week 3 Assignment - 58.00"**: This shows the score for
the Week 3 assignment. * **"Go to Course page >"**: A call to action button or
link to access the full course page. **Graphical Elements:** * There's a dark
background overlayed with patterns (potentially dots) and curved shapes behind
the "Tools in Data Science" course title. This visually separates the course
title and enrollment information from the rest of the page. **Inferences and
Context:** * The image likely comes from a student portal or online learning
management system (LMS). * The course is "Tools in Data Science", and the user
is enrolled in it and is repeating the course. * There's information about the
user's performance on assignments, allowing them to track their progress. In
summary, the image presents a snapshot of a user's current courses,
specifically focusing on a "Tools in Data Science" course, and provides
assignment progress information. The design and layout are consistent with
those of online learning platforms. ]Screenshot 2025-02-12 151022427×596 28.1

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image displays a web page or application interface
with a dark theme. It's divided into sections: * **Header:** Shows login
information and a logout button. * **Main Content:** Displays recent saved
data, likely related to a game or assessment. **Textual Elements:** * **Login
Information:** "You are logged in as 22f2000559@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." This
indicates the user's email address associated with their account. * **Logout
Button:** A button labeled "Logout" provides the option to exit the session. *
**Section Heading:** "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)". This
tells users the section is showing their saved data and clarifies which save
counts as their official score. * **Save Details:** * Three save entries, each
with similar structure. * Each entry has a "Reload" button. * Date and time
stamp for each save. * 2/3/2025, 12:00:10 AM * 2/2/2025, 11:59:20 PM *

Features:** * **Color Scheme:** Dark background with green for the main
content section and white text. The "Logout" button has a red border. *
**Buttons:** "Reload" buttons are present for each save entry. * **Layout
Consistency:** The save entries are presented in a consistent format,

likely depicts a user interface for a game, quiz, or assessment where scores
are saved. The "Recent saves" section provides a history of the user's
performance. The user's official score is the most recent saved score. The
"Reload" button could be used to restore or replay a specific saved state.

Sir, I have attempted the graded assignment 2 and also saved it but my score
is showing as absent. Please look into the issue sir.  
My email id is 23f1002071@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image depicts a webpage or a screen capture of a web
application, likely related to an online test or assignment. The layout is

the save (e.g., "from 2/3/2025, 10:27:40 AM") * The associated score (e.g.,
"Score: 5.5") **Key Observations & Interpretations:** * The application
appears to be for an online quiz or test, given the presence of scores, a
deadline, save options, and a discussion forum. * The test has already ended,
as indicated by the header information. * The user's email address is
displayed, suggesting they are logged in. * The "Recent Saves" section
indicates that the user has made multiple attempts, and the most recent save
is considered the official score. * The scores of previous saves provide a
history of the user's progress. In summary, the image shows a user's account
page for an online test/quiz that has ended, displaying the user's login
information, a link to a discussion forum, and a list of past saves with their
associated scores. The most recent save reflects the official score. ]graded

Langu" - Indicates this is likely a programming assessment as part of a larger
course. * **URL:** "https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3" - This is

loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser." *
"Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT,
friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want." * "It's
hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the
code for this quiz. That's allowed." * "Note: You'll run multiple servers in
this exam. All of them must be running simultaneously while checking or saving
answers." * **Discussion Link:** "Have questions? Join the discussion on

version is evaluated. * **Resource Usage:** Students are explicitly allowed to
use any resources, including internet, AI tools, and libraries. * **Server
Architecture:** The exam runs on multiple servers simultaneously. * **Explicit
permission of hacking to get to the answer.** In short, the image is a
snapshot of an online programming exam interface. It shows the student's
status, instructions, and previous saves. The most striking feature is the
explicit permission to use any resource, including hacking, to solve the
problems. ]Screenshot (674)1920×1080 273 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

This is summary from start to finish + doubt clearing

[Image description: Here's a description of the image: The image shows a
stylized, pixelated rendition of the YouTube play button. It's primarily red
with a white play triangle in the center. The red background is not a perfect
square, but more of a rounded rectangle or capsule shape. Due to the low
resolution and pixelated nature, details are limited. The play triangle is
blurry, and the edges of the shape are rough rather than smooth.]

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a Google Meet video
call. The main focus is a person's video feed in the center, surrounded by a
large black background. There's also the Google Meet logo in the top-right
corner and a name in the bottom-left. **Detailed Features:** * **Central Video
Feed:** The video feed is displayed within a circular frame. It shows a man
with a medium complexion, dark hair, and a beard/mustache. He's wearing a
yellow t-shirt with some text on it (part of the text visible is "the same
vibe"). The background behind him suggests an outdoor setting, possibly a
bridge or walkway with trees and vegetation in the distance. * **Text:** *
Bottom Left: "Gokul Vasudevan S" (likely the name of the person in the video
feed) * Top Right: "Google Meet" (the application being used) * **Logo:** *
The Google Meet logo is visible in the top-right corner of the image. **In
Summary:** This image is a screenshot from a Google Meet call featuring a
person named Gokul Vasudevan S. The background suggests he is outside. The
screenshot shows the Google Meet interface elements, including the logo and
the call user's name.]

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-02-18T05:38:11.568Z)

[@23f2000237](/u/23f2000237)

You got 80 in ga4. And the bonus makes it to 90.

Thats what we have on our system.

Kindly post a screenshot of your dashboard if 90 is not showing for GA4

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall
Structure:** The image appears to be a preview or summary of a course. It's
structured in sections: 1\. **Header:** A title section with course name and a
"NEW COURSE" label. 2\. **Grades:** A list of assignments and their scores,
broken down by week. 3\. **Call to Action:** A button or link to visit the
course page. **Textual Content:** * **"Tools in Data Science"**: This is the
name of the course. * **"NEW COURSE"**: A label indicating that this is a
recent offering. * **"Week 1 Assignment - 88.00"**: Indicates the score for
the assignment of Week 1 and so on. * **"Week 2 Assignment - 55.00"** *
**"Week 3 Assignment - 74.00"** * **"Week 4 Assignment - 80.00"** * **"Go to
Course page >"**: This is a call to action, likely a button or link,
encouraging the user to visit the full course page for more details. **Visual
Elements:** * The background of the header has a burgundy gradient and a
pattern of circles/dots. * The "Go to Course page" is formatted with a button-
like border. **Interpretation:** The image likely represents a user's view of
a course dashboard or a summary of their progress in a "Tools in Data Science"
course. It shows the grades received for each week's assignment and provides a
direct link to the full course page. ]IMG_06441170×981 116

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, Now it’s showing “Absent” in both Week 1 & 2 GA :  

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Layout and Design:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage or a
learning management system, likely related to an online course. It showcases a

COURSE" - Indicates that this is a course being taken again. * **Week
Assignments:** A list of assignments and their status for each week. * "Week 1

of a course progress or summary page. It shows the course title, whether the
student is repeating the course, the status/scores of the assignments for the

Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure
of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with
getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations
team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem.  
(Its a data cleaning and packaging issue - a typical TDS problem :rofl:)

### Anushka Kumar (2025-02-18T08:08:48.788Z)

Okay sir, no worries then. Thank you for the explanation.

### Pranaav (2025-02-16T18:36:33.302Z)

I have completed and checked and even saved the assignment for GA2 and GA3,
however it says that I was absent for both GA2 and GA3.

Please check my assignment and ensure that it has been corrected, since I have
checked the website and I had submitted.

Thank you

### Chinmay Kapoor (2025-02-17T07:28:26.892Z)

Mine too but only for GA2. I have submitted and ensured it was checked and
saved the assignment on Ex website but it shows that I was absent.

Can you check your dashboard (not your seek portal, dashboard is where all
your course cards are visible). I have been informed by Operations that the
scores have been pushed for week 1 to week 4 (including the bonus mark for
discourse post in week 4)

Kind regards

### Pranaav (2025-02-18T05:29:49.175Z)

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image shows a banner or card-style graphic, likely
related to an online course or learning platform. The top part of the graphic
has a dark, maroon background with a pattern of small dots. Below this
section, there is a white rectangular area containing information about course
assignments. At the very bottom, there is a "Go to Course page >" button.
**Text and Content:** * **Title:** "Tools in Data Science" * **Subtitle:**
"NEW COURSE" * **Assignments:** * "Week 1 Assignment - 95.00" * "Week 2
Assignment - Absent" * "Week 3 Assignment - Absent" * "Week 4 Assignment -
70.00" * **Button:** "Go to Course page >" **Visual Features:** * The color
scheme mainly uses maroon and white. * The dotted background gives a textured
effect. * The text is clearly readable. **In Summary:** The image promotes a
"Tools in Data Science" course and displays the status of weekly assignments
for a student. It shows scores for weeks 1 and 4, but indicates that weeks 2
and 3 assignments are absent. The button at the bottom likely links to the
course's main page. ]image434×416 19 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

### Chinmay Kapoor (2025-02-18T07:45:48.778Z)

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: **Overall:**
The image appears to be a screenshot of a course interface, likely from an
online learning platform. It shows information about a course titled "Tools in
Data Science," student progress on assignments, and a call-to-action button.
**Visual Elements:** * **Top Section (Course Title):** The top portion has a
dark reddish-brown background with a pattern of small circles. This section
displays the course title "Tools in Data Science" in white text, along with
"NEW COURSE" also in white. * **Middle Section (Assignments):** The middle
section contains a list of weekly assignments and their corresponding status
or grades: * Week 1 Assignment - 100.00 * Week 2 Assignment - Absent * Week 3
Assignment - 85.00 * Week 4 Assignment - 60.00 * **Bottom Section (Call to
Action):** The bottom part has a button or a link labelled "Go to Course page
>" in red-brown text. The ">" indicates it's a link to navigate to the course
page. **Textual Elements:** * **Course Title:** "Tools in Data Science" *
**Status:** "NEW COURSE" * **Assignment Details:** "Week 1 Assignment -
100.00", "Week 2 Assignment - Absent", "Week 3 Assignment - 85.00", "Week 4
Assignment - 60.00" * **Call to Action:** "Go to Course page >"
**Interpretation:** The image depicts a student's view of a "Tools in Data
Science" course. The student has received a perfect score on Week 1's
assignment, was absent or missed Week 2, scored 85 on Week 3, and scored 60 on
Week 4. The "Go to Course page" button is likely used to access the main
course content, modules, or other resources. ]Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.14.23

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,  
I recently checked my marks for Tool in Data Science and noticed a major
discrepancy. In the subject dashboard, my marks are shown as 100 , but in the
main Dashboard, I have been awarded absent .

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: The image
displays a section of what appears to be a course or module progress
interface. **Content:** * **Module 1:** The top portion is dedicated to
"Module 1: Development Tools." * **Assignment:** Under the module title, it
lists an assignment called "Graded Assignment 1." The assessment's due date is
specified as "26 Jan 2025." Below the assignment name, "Submitted" in a green
color suggests that the assignment was successfully submitted. * **Scores:** A
table-like structure is presented showing "Your Score," "Peer Average," and
"Median Score." * "Your Score" is shown as 100 with a "View Chart" button
underneath. * "Peer Average" is shown as 99% with a "View Chart" button
underneath. * "Median Score" is shown as 100. * **Module 2:** At the bottom,
it begins to introduce "Module 2: Deployment Tools," indicating that this
interface likely shows a progression through multiple modules. **Overall
Impression:** The image gives the impression of a well-organized and detailed
course or assignment tracking interface, with clear indication of progress,
scores, and comparative data with peers.]Screenshot 2025-02-18 1824011574×450

[@23f2004320](/u/23f2004320)

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.

Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server.
Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked
whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.

The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.

Kind regards.

Sir for the GA3 the saved score says its 4.5, total is 9.5 so my total should
be 47.4.

According to your submission history your last submission before the deadline
was 3.5 (i.e. your score would be 36.8 out of 100)

Kind regards

### Sakthivel S (2025-02-20T10:23:24.676Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton), the error has been rectified, and the corrected mark
has now been accurately reflected in the system.

Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted
answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in
current courses tab.  
I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i
submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.

[@shubham6](/u/shubham6) I have checked the backend server. It does show your
score as 8 for GA2, so we have the correct score for you.

Can you send me a screenshot of your dashboard (where your course cards are)
thanks.

Kind regards
