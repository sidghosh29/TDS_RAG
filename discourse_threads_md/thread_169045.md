# Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread

### Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective
assignments

### Why? :interrobang::thinking:

If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?

### Too many Questions for LLM :nerd_face::nerd_face::nerd_face:

True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use
relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer

### What We need from YOU 🫵🏽

Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?

### How?

  * If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
  * If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful :+1:t3::+1:t3:

    # TDS-Project2-QuestionBank
    Question Bank for all TDS assignments
    
    # Requested format
    ## Student Assignments Directory Structure
    
    Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
    - A `.txt` file with the question statement.
    - A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.
    
    ### Example Directory Structure
    RollNo_12345/
    ├── Assignment_1/
    │   ├── Q1.txt    # Question for Q1
    │   ├── Q1.py     # Solution in Python
    │   ├── Q2.txt    # Question for Q2
    │   ├── Q2.sh     # Solution in Bash
    │   ├── Q3.txt    # Question for Q3
    │   ├── Q3.js     # Solution in JavaScript
    ├── Assignment_2/

This time I’ll create a functioning script way before deadline for everyone to
use .  
[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: The image
features a pirate flag waving in the wind against a blue sky dotted with
fluffy white clouds. The flag itself is black, and on it is a stylized skull
and crossbones design. The skull is white with large, cartoonish eye sockets
and a wide, toothy grin. A straw hat with a red band is perched atop the
skull. The crossbones are also white and arranged behind the skull in a
classic pirate flag fashion. The flag is attached to a wooden flagpole, which
is visible on the left side of the image. The pole is textured and appears to
be made of multiple sections joined together. The background sky is a vibrant
blue, with clouds scattered throughout. Overall, the image has a cheerful and
adventurous feel. ]
