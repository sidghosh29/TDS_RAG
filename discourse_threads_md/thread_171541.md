I am unable to open the files shared by the students I am peer reviewing as I
don’t have access to them on my student email. Since we were asked to give
access to se2002@study.iitm.ac.in when submitting, I wanted to check how this
will work—will the team provide us access, or do we need to request it from
the student and wait for them to grant it?"

If u dont have access to the google sheet of ur peer while trying reviewing ,
it means u can just give them 0 and leave (mentioned in the mail they sent )

Request access from the peer.

Also dont forget to give view permissions to your submissions.

Kind regards

I have completed my allotted 3 peer reviews, I was wondering if it’s possible
to do more peer reviews for extra credit? I ask because all 3 of my allotted
peer reviews were empty submissions and I don’t feel like I actually did any
work :sweat_smile:
