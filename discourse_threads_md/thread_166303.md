The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a
strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large
Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a
structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir i watch live session recording , but still not
getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these
words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please .
At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to
above of our head .

Hi Hari,

The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with
perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science.
Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at
least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded
Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions
were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a
conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is
always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This
is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We
cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or
not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students.
The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and
well attended.

Have you watched this session in particular?

If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just
introducing it

[ [Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on the text, objects, and relevant features: **Overall Layout:** * The image shows a computer screen, likely during a video call or screen sharing session. * The screen is divided into two main sections. The left side displays a browser window, and the right side shows the video call participant. **Browser Window (Left Side):** * The browser appears to be Opera. * The browser window is open to the "Speed Dial" page. This page has several shortcut icons. * The background of the Speed Dial page is an orange anime-style graphic depicting the character Naruto. **Speed Dial Shortcuts:** * **Top Row:** * "amit" (with a brown background and the letter "A") * "TDS Discourse" (with a brown background and a flame icon) * "App Dev II Project Doc..." (with a brown background and a document icon) * "(159) Tools in Data Scie..." (with a brown background and a YouTube icon) * "Java Tutorial | Learn Jav..." (with a brown background and a "T" logo) * "Prime Number Progra..." (with a brown background and a "J" logo) * **Bottom Row:** * "PDSA" (with a brown background and a flame icon) * "Java" (with a brown background and a flame icon) * "tds june 2024" (with a brown background and a flame icon) * "MAD-2 resources" (with a brown background and a "V" logo) **Taskbar (Bottom of Screen):** * The Windows taskbar is visible. * There's a search bar labeled "Type here to search." * Several icons are present, including: * A Windows icon * An Opera icon * A Team icon * A "Th" icon * An English language indicator ("ENG") * Date and time: "20:14 11-07-2024" **Video Call Participant (Right Side):** * A black screen shows the video call participant. * The name displayed is "Amit Kumar Gupta." * There is a white icon with a flame shape inside a circle. **Additional Details:** * The Windows installation appears to be unactivated, as indicated by the "Activate Windows" watermark. * The browser has tabs open including: * "Meet - odh-ycbm-ahj" * "Large Language Models" * "Speed Dial" In summary, the image captures a screen during a virtual meeting or presentation, showcasing the presenter's browser window with several programming-related shortcuts and a profile picture of the participant "Amit Kumar Gupta." ] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OdReZsvi2w)

followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases

[ [Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: **Content
Overview:** The image shows a screenshot of a computer screen. On the left is
a browser window, displaying a course website. On the right side of the screen
is a video call window, showing a person named Carlton D'Silva. **Left Side
(Course Website):** * **Browser Information:** The browser is Chrome, with
various tabs open, including "Indian Insti," "Meet-," "Data sourci," "TDS LLM
S," "TDS LLM," "LLM Topic," "TDS Topic," "Inbox (2)," and "ChatGPT." *
**URL:** The URL in the address bar is
`https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_24t2_se2002?id=160&type=lesson&tab=courses&unitid=158`.
This indicates the user is on the website for an online degree program at IIT
Madras. * **Course Details:** The website displays the IIT Madras logo and
"May 2024 - TDS" indicating the course name or timeframe. The user is viewing
the "Data sourcing" module. * **Modules List:** A sidebar on the left displays
the course modules: * Course introduction * Self assessment * 1. Data
discovery * 2. Data sourcing (currently selected) * Inbox (showing "2"
notifications) * Discuss * Graded Assignment 2 Assignment * 3. Data
preparation * 4. Data analysis * 5. Large language models * Project 1 & 2 *
**Data Sourcing Content:** The "Data sourcing" module page contains the
following text: * **Title:** Data sourcing * **Rating:** ★★★★★ 5/5 (2 reviews)
* **Action:** Submit a review * **Instructions:** * "Control Extraction Area:
Specify page and area coordinates to accurately extract tables, avoiding
extraneous text." * "Save Extracted Data: Convert the extracted table data
into structured formats like CSV for further analysis." * **Links:** * PDF
Scraping - Notebook * Learn about the tabula package * Learn about the pandas
package. Video * **Section Title:** Optional: Real-life scraping *
**Description:** "In this live scraping session, we explore a real-life
scenario where Straive had to scrape data from emarketer.com for a demo. This
is a fairly realistic and representative way of how one might go about
scraping a website." * **Screenshot:** There's also a screenshot of what seems
to be a scraping project of a website called "eMarketer." **Right Side (Video
Call):** * **Person:** A man with glasses, identified as Carlton D'Silva. *
**Layout:** The video call window occupies a portion of the right side of the
screen. **Bottom of Screen (Dock):** The MacOS dock is visible with icons for
Finder, Launchpad, Safari, Chrome, Mail, Messages, App Store, Settings,
Terminal, VS Code, a Database application, Whatsapp, Github, etc. **Overall
Impression:** The image captures a scene of online learning. Someone is taking
a course on data sourcing (likely data science or related) and participating
in a live session that covers practical aspects like web scraping. The video
call allows for interaction and potentially live demonstrations from the
instructor. ] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELZf0n_0u9w)

But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand
it? That depends on the student.

Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them
because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

Kind regards
