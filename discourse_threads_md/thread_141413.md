Hello Sir, [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

As TDS is one of the most important courses in the data science diploma, I
respectfully want to bring up a concern. The TDS roe exam is almost impossible
to solve within the given time frame. While the team might aim to develop
certain skills in students, I would like you to consider this: having an exam
that is nearly impossible to complete in the allotted time which is a
statement by your side…

My question is, why is this exam graded and carrying 20% weightage towards the
final grade? Is this fair? we are loosing marks for the exam in which almost
no one can score average. This situation is causing CGPAs to drop
significantly. I request the team to consider this issue. Either make this
exam ungraded or reduce its weightage. This is a very serious issue, as many
of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.

Thank you for your consideration.

I completely understand and share the concerns about the time constraints of
the TDS exam. Given the challenging nature of the test, it seems quite
difficult to complete all the questions within the allotted 45 minutes.

I believe even the course team would find it challenging to solve this exam in
such a short time frame.

This way, we can ensure that the grading is equitable and does not unfairly
impact our CGPAs. I hope the team can consider this suggestion.

TDS ROE is a reality check on your true skills. Rather than face FAANG type
tests when it really matters and get a shock that you are at the bottom of the
pile, it is better you face reality now in an environment that does not unduly
penalises you.

> This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly.

While that seems like a nice sound bite, let’s look at the data as true data
scientists rather than let emotion lead our thoughts.

If you get an S in TDS, its weight to your total Diploma CGPA will be 5.55%.  
When you consider that ROE is worth 20% of that, the overall effect on your
diploma CGPA at BEST is 1.11% if you score 100% in it. The TRUE effect **is
lower** if you take into consideration you can offset at least 25% of that
loss with bonus questions (worth 5% of the TDS grade)!

> This is a very serious issue

A little over dramatic a statement considering the data we now have considered
above. The reality is the ROE is worth 0.83% of your overall diploma CGPA (and
that too this is the worst case, i.e. for direct diploma students! For those
that started from foundation its impact **is even smaller! 0.52%)**

What is my opinion on ROE? It made me a better student. I was truly humbled by
the experience. It gave me a realistic view of my abilities and the level I
need to attain so that I can be confident in the value I am adding to the
client. Who is the client? The businesses I might deal with, the companies I
contract for.

If there was no value attached to the ROE (i.e. you have no stake in it) then
all the evidence points to one very simple truth. Nearly no one taking it
seriously.

> many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree
> level.

My mother has always said one thing to me. Its only an undergraduate degree.
If you are struggling in year 2, then stop wasting your time, its not meant
for you.

ROE is not harsh. ROE is like my mother’s very wise advice. There are many,
many examples of students dropping out of university and being successful in
life. **Do not waste your time,** its more valuable than anything you possess.
If you are struggling, to even maintain a 6 CGPA requirement to enter the
degree level because of an ROE that contributes > 0.834%, then the very best
advice you will ever receive from me is: Do not waste your time with this
degree.

I say this with all sincerity and truth. I am living evidence, as are many
others, you do not need this degree to succeed in life. The reason I am doing
this degree is because I realised that I actually enjoy this course and I find
real value from it and hope to make a difference for good with what I learn
from it.

Although it is called the impossible exam, our data shows that there are
several students that have done well in the ROE. ROE is not harsh. It’s a
reality check, its a mother’s advice and a very inexpensive, truthful and
effective one.

Humbly for your kind consideration

Carlton at his best again !!! [@carlton](/u/carlton) my apologies for being
dramatic but I have been a TA for one of the foundational level courses and
after that I gave up on being TA despite of having good grades in some
subjects , to be honest at this point of time I envy you … You are nailing it
as a TA …one of the best TAs I have seen in this course.[Image description:

Since ROE is done and whatever everyone has scored cannot be changed. Well, we
can make up for the marks that we lost by having few more extra activities, if
that’s possible [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir. That way we get back what we lost,
improve CGPA (irrespective of whatever CGPA one has) and learn in the process
that would be a win-win situation for everyone.

Thanks & Regards,

### Anupam Chandra (2024-07-29T10:19:12.231Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton), we are mixing something straightforward as the ability
to score an S or A grade in TDS with a philosophical outlook on the topic.

The philosophy is helpful if the grades for most students are following a
standard bell curve (average of all subjects or average of TDS over the last
few semensters) and a few students are outliers in terms of the grading. For
e.g., if I score a lower than expected grade and I am feeling demotivated, I
can understand what you just wrote and it is indeed very much to the point.

However, if the entire grading bell curve has shifted and most students are
not scoring grades as per expectation, it is time for the instructors to
consider whether the grading pattern needs to be tweaked (20% for an
“impossible” ROE is perhaps on the higher side) or students need to be
provided with alternate paths to a decent grade (like extra assignments for
10-20 marks in lieu of the loss of marks above mentioned ROE).

I would like to reiterate that my observations above are only w.r.t. a
standard grading bell curve for all subjects or for TDS from previous terms.

Do note that all IITs follow normalization of marks and grades as a standard
activity so that students can focus on learning and giving it their best
rather than worrying about grades. This is not the case in this course, so we
should think about alternative grading patterns without compromising on the
rigour of the course in any way.

> if the entire grading bell curve has shifted

Disagree with this if you mean the bell curve has shifted between terms. RoE
has been really tough since the past 3 terms at least (I haven’t checked with
students who did it before that, so I don’t know about those). Or if the issue
is a bell curve mismatch between different subjects, we shouldn’t be expecting
that to be perfect. Some of the subjects were extremely easy, but nobody
complained about those [Image description: Here's a detailed description of
the image: **Content:** The image shows a bright yellow circular face emoji.
**Key Features:** * **Yellow Color:** The primary color of the emoji is a
vibrant yellow. * **Facial Features:** * It has two oval-shaped, black eyes. *
It features a wide, open smile with white teeth visible. * The inside of the
mouth is pink. * **Background:** The background is black. **Overall
Impression:** The image is a classic, cheerful, and simple emoji representing
happiness or joy.]

For what it’s worth, I also felt it was tough beyond reason. These sort of
exams where the time required far exceeds the time given is more typical of
competitive exams where the score isn’t important, only your rank is. All that
being said, I still didn’t complain since the difficulty is “real”, and not
made-up like with BDM theory/project. With the first, the difficulty comes
from an extremely poor grading system, and with the second, from having to
find a business that will share data. The subjects themselves don’t pose a
significant intellectual challenge.

Also, is an S at TDS really hard this term? I scored one last term despite a
poor RoE performance. I’m unable to recall now whether they gave us some extra
marks out of pity [Image description: Here's a detailed description of the
image: **Content:** * **Primary Subject:** The image features a standard
yellow smiling face emoji. * **Facial Features:** * The emoji has oval-shaped,
black eyes. * It has a wide, open mouth showing white teeth and a hint of a
pink tongue inside. * The face is round and colored in a bright, solid yellow.
* **Background:** The background is solid black. **Overall Impression:** The
image is a simple depiction of a happy, smiling emoji, set against a dark
background. It's a clear and straightforward representation of the emotion of
happiness or positivity.]

PS: There is no implication from any of my remarks that I will stop sharing
RoE jokes/memes [Image description: Here's a detailed description of the
image: The image shows a single object: a yellow circular emoji. The emoji is
a winking face. * **Color:** The emoji is primarily yellow, consistent with
common emoji designs. * **Facial features:** It has a single eye open, while
the other eye is closed in a wink. The mouth is curved into a slight smile. An
eyebrow is present above the open eye. * **Overall Impression:** The emoji
conveys a playful or suggestive tone, often used to imply that the preceding
statement should not be taken entirely seriously, or to indicate flirtation or
mischief.]

Come on. I didn’t complain. I just gave my observations. In fact, the only
time I really complained in this course was when I was suddenly left hanging
because the ROE stopped 15 minutes before the time shown in the portal. That
was then. After seeing the difficulty level of the repeat ROE from yesterday,
I’ve decided that I’m one of the lucky ones who was able to attempt the ROE
last Sunday, regardless of the mess up from the support team.

I’ve also said many times on Discourse that I think this is one of the best
courses at IITM and nothing about it should be changed. I don’t know how you
got an S in spite of a poor ROE. For me, I will have to score a perfect 100%
in the ET to get an S, so I was just being realisitic when I requested for
additional assignments to give students a fighting chance to score an S.

### Arun (2024-07-29T12:10:28.624Z)

Sorry, didn’t mean to say that you’re complaining. Meant literally that I
didn’t complain despite the unusual difficulty level though this sort of thing
is usually a cause for concern.

Maybe we got some extra marks last term then, I’m not sure. (A student with
better memory than me can chime in)

At the beginning of every term they send you an email for the subjects you are
eligible to become a TA. If you are interested you have to fill up the form
given in the mail.

### Sarath E (2024-07-29T12:59:13.618Z)

[@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) They will contact you before the start of
term if you done well in a subject.  
[@Arun2](/u/arun2) I think last term they gave an extra 5 mark bonus for the
Roe mishap ?
