### Bhashwar Sengupta (2025-03-01T08:59:36.183Z)

Would we be able to start work on the questions 1 hour before the exam start
time?


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-01T09:01:56.407Z)

[@bhashwar_sengupta](/u/bhashwar_sengupta) No that will not be possible. It
will go live only at 1 pm.


---
### Bhashwar Sengupta (2025-03-01T09:40:09.245Z)

Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we
need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?


---
### Yogesh (2025-03-01T11:19:35.700Z)

Is it 45 minutes long?


---
### Vinil (2025-03-01T15:16:32.904Z)

No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’


---
### Akshit Mittal (2025-03-01T16:34:53.754Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton) will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like
other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like
we had for Weekly GA?


---
### Muthupalaniappan (2025-03-01T16:45:45.614Z)

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in
youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings?


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-02T02:43:00.880Z)

All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a
special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving
component. These are all available on the Youtube channel

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content: The
image presents a table containing information about courses, their timings,
and exam links, all related to a date in the future. **Overall Structure:** *
The image primarily consists of a table with column headers: "COURSE NAME,"
"TIMING," and "EXAM LINK." * The table is likely intended to provide a
schedule or guide for upcoming courses or exams. * Text annotations and
instructions are present below the table. **Table Content:** * **Date:** The
table is associated with the date "March 02nd 2025." * **Courses:** The table
lists four courses: * "Python A1 (P1 to P64)" * "Python A2 (P65 to P128)" *
"Java" * "TDS ROE" * **Timing:** The timings are specified for each course.
All timings appear to be in the AM except for TDS ROE. * Python A1: "09:30 AM
to 11:30 AM" * Python A2: "09:30 AM to 11:30 AM" * Java: "09:30 AM to 11:00
AM" * TDS ROE: "01:00PM to 01:45PM" * **Exam Links:** The "EXAM LINK" column
provides information on where to access the exams, with the links provided for
TDS ROE. * Python A1: "CLOSED" * Python A2: "CLOSED" * Java: "CLOSED" * TDS
ROE: "https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe" **Additional Text:** *
"Important Links for OPPE" (appears below the table) * "**All timing are in
IST**" (appears below the table, highlighted in yellow) * "Instructions"
(appears below the table, highlighted in yellow) * "Seeya is now integrated
with google chrome & it will work only in Updated version of chrome." (appears
below the table). **Graphical Elements:** * The table is formatted with lines
to separate rows and columns. * The table uses a light blue background color
for the header row. * Some of the text is highlighted in bold and colored
yellow. **Overall Impression:** The image is a structured document providing
information about courses, their schedules, and exam links. It appears to be
an official notice or a guide, providing specific instructions and details for
the upcoming courses or exams. The information about the IST timezone and the
Chrome integration suggests that this is likely an online examination.

### Vicky Kumar (2025-03-02T07:05:05.567Z)

This Problem is happening to me  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image shows a screenshot of a webpage. It's likely a
troubleshooting page for an online quiz or test. The design is simple, with a
mostly white background and a dark gray header. **Textual Elements:** *
**Title:** "Trouble seeing questions?" * **Troubleshooting Steps:** A numbered
list of suggestions is provided: 1\. Try with Chrome or Edge. This site needs
a modern, not-too-privacy-sensitive browser. 2\. Disable ad or cookie

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image displays a screenshot of what appears to be a
website or web application's user interface. It's divided into two main
sections: 1\. **Troubleshooting Advice:** The upper portion provides guidance
for users who are having trouble viewing content, particularly questions. 2\.
**Error Message:** The lower portion shows an error message in a box. **Text
and Content:** * **Heading:** "Trouble seeing questions?" indicates that the
user is likely experiencing problems with content display. * **Troubleshooting
List:** A numbered list gives possible solutions: 1\. Try with Chrome or Edge
- suggests using a modern, privacy-sensitive browser. 2\. Disable ad or cookie
blockers - advises turning off these features due to the site's use of third-
party cookies for authentication. 3\. Enable JavaScript - JavaScript is
essential for the site's functionality. 4\. Try without browser extensions in
Incognito or InPrivate mode - suggests using a clean browsing environment
without extensions. 5\. Try disabling aggressive anti-virus software - some
anti-virus programs may interfere with site operation. * **Error Message
Box:** A dark red box with the following content: * "Error!" - The title of
the error message. * "Sorry, we couldn't find the quiz tds-2025-01-roe. You
might have the wrong link." - Indicates that the specific quiz file or link is
not found, or the user has an incorrect link. * "Please contact the exam team
for assistance." - Advises the user to reach out to the exam team for support.
**Visual Style:** * **Colors:** The background is dark, and the error message
box has a dark red fill. The text appears to be in a light color (likely white
or a light shade of grey) for readability against the dark background. **In
Summary:** The image conveys a situation where a user is encountering display
problems on a website or application, possibly during an online exam. The
troubleshooting tips attempt to address common browser configuration issues
that could cause the problems. When this does not work, an error message
states the specific quiz could not be found, and they should contact the exam
team. ]Screenshot 2025-03-02 at 3.05.07 pm1532×956 72

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on the
text, objects, and features that might be relevant for answering questions:
**Overall Layout** The image shows a split screen, with the left side
displaying a web browser window and the right side displaying a code editor
(likely Visual Studio Code) with a Thunder Client (API client) window. **Left
Side - Web Browser (Exam Interface)** * **Title Bar:** The tab in the browser
reads "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roefhq-stackoverflow.commo...".
This indicates a web-based exam interface. * **Time/Score:** The timer
displays "00:26:36 left", and the score is "Score: 0/10". * **List of
Questions:** A list of questions is shown, including: * LLM Embeddings (1
mark) * Region Containing Point (1 mark) * Shortest Path Between Cities (1
mark) * Calculate correlation (1 mark) * **Current Question:** The current
question is: "Write a FastAPI proxy server (1 mark)". * **Question
Description:** The task asks the user to write a FastAPI proxy server that: *
Serves data from a given URL. * Adds a CORS header: `Access-Control-Allow-
Origin: *` to the response. * **Example:** An example is provided: * API URL
endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` * Request:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3Fkey%3Dvalue` *
Expected behavior: The server should return data from
`https://example.com/?key=value` with the CORS header. * **Note:** It mentions
to keep the server running for the duration of the exam. * **Answer Field:** A
text input field is present, labeled "What is your FastAPI Proxy URL
endpoint?". The current value is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. * **Error
Message:** The error message reads: "Error: Incorrect response" indicating
that the entered endpoint is not working correctly. * **Check Logic:** The
message "We'll check by sending a request to this URL with `?url=...` check if
the response matches the data." describes how the system validates the
submitted answer. **Right Side - Code Editor (Visual Studio Code) and Thunder
Client** * **Thunder Client:** The Thunder Client application is being used to
make API requests. * **API Request:** A GET request is being made to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%`. The URL
parameter is URL encoded, likely representing `https://example.com/`. *
**Response:** The Status is `200 OK` and the response body indicates that the
requested url (`https://example.com`) successfully returned the example
domain. The response content: * `<html>` * `<head>` * `<h1>Example
Domain</h1>` * `<p>This domain is for use in illustrative examples in
documents. ...</p>` * **Terminal Output:** The terminal displays a history of
requests, including: **Key Observations & Potential Issues** * **URL
Encoding:** The exam interface and Thunder Client both involve URL-encoded
URLs in the `url` parameter. The correct encoding is crucial. * **CORS
Header:** The key requirement is to add the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
header in the FastAPI response. * **Endpoint:** The provided endpoint of
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` is being rejected by the exam system. This implies
there's a mismatch between the expected endpoint and the one provided by the
user's FastAPI application. This may be due to incorrect server setup. *
**Terminal History:** The terminal output shows that the user has tried
several variations of URLs, including attempts to access `httpbin.org` and
`example.com`. **In summary, the user is attempting to solve a coding
challenge where they need to create a FastAPI proxy server that forwards
requests to a given URL and adds the CORS header. The error indicates the
server either is not running correctly, not accessible from the exam system,
or it is failing to return the data as expected.** ]Screenshot (92)1920×1080

### Sagandeep Kaur (2025-03-02T08:27:41.776Z)

ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the
best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it.

### Saransh Saini (2025-03-02T08:30:53.155Z)

Your answer is absolutely correct [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573)  
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal
places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

Hello Sir"s, [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But
due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.  
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could
already check my answers were in the portal.

I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due
a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode  
[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: The image

restoring data. The primary elements within the frame are: * **Title**: At the

This serves as a header for the section, informing the user about the
information being presented. * **Reload Option**: A light blue button labeled
"Reload" indicates an action the user can take, likely to load or refresh
saved data. * **Timestamp**: To the right of the "Reload" button, the text
"from 3/2/2025, 1:47:43 PM. S" provides a timestamp, suggesting a specific
time when data was saved or last updated. The date is in the format
month/day/year. The overall color scheme appears to be light, with a green
background, enhancing the visibility of the text and button. The image
suggests that it is part of a user interface that provides options for
managing recent saves or backups of data.]

Hi [@Muthupalaniappan](/u/muthupalaniappan)  
We have got multiple issues like from other students, we are looking into it
and figuring out what all we can do.

rounded off, i would taken as correct

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) as I already showed
you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for
surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it’s showing 0 and
dint get submitted properly…

As you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted
everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly
impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and
give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also
attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** * The image captures a screenshot of a webpage, likely
related to an online exam. The webpage has a dark theme. * At the top, there's
a browser address bar with the URL
"https://exam.sanandworkers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe". Other browser elements like
tabs, extension icons, and favorites are visible. **Header Area:** * A
prominent red bar indicates the exam has ended. The text reads: "Ended at Sun,
2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST". It also displays "Score: 0" and "Check all" and
"Save" buttons. **Main Content Area:** * **Title:** "Bonus mark" is displayed
in large font. * **Bonus Information:** Text instructs the user to fill out a
form before 5 pm IST to get a bonus mark. It specifies the bonus details are

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded
unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I
had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on
the last two.  

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image's content: **Overall
Layout:** * The image appears to be a screenshot of a web interface or
application. **Textual Information:** * **Login Status:** "You are logged in
as 22f1000535@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." This indicates the user is authenticated
and identifies their account. * **Logout Button:** There's a "Logout" button,
presumably to end the current session. * **Recent Saves:** A section labeled
"Recent saves (most recent is your official score)". This suggests the
application involves saving data, and the latest save is considered the
official score. * **Save Entries:** Two save entries are displayed. Each
includes: * A "Reload" button. * The date and time of the save: "from
3/2/2025, 3:16:50 AM" and "from 3/2/2025, 3:15:46 AM". * A "Score" associated
with each save: "Score: 8" for both entries. **Visual Elements:** * **Color
Scheme:** Dark background with lighter text, highlighting the key information.
* **Buttons:** The "Logout" and "Reload" elements are styled as buttons. *
**Organization:** Information is clearly grouped, making it easy to understand
at a glance. **In Summary:** The image shows a user logged into a system
(likely related to "ds.study.iitm.ac.in"). The user has a score of 8, and the
image displays recent save data. ]image940×568 36.4

### P V SHRAVAN (2025-03-02T08:50:48.253Z)

you have to filter students with marks 30 or more in maths not biology and
then answer to question is total biology mark you have found the total maths
mark

and times:

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content,
focusing on text, objects, and relevant features: **Overall Structure:** The
image appears to be a screenshot of a web application, likely related to an
online assessment or assignment platform. The layout includes a header
section, a login information area, a "Recent Saves" section, and a "Questions"
section. **Header Section:** * **Timer:** "00:19:29 left" indicating time
remaining. * **Score:** "Score: 10/10" suggesting a perfect score. *
**Buttons:** "Check all" and "Save" implying options to review and save the
current work. * **Information Box:** Contains links to "Join Discourse" and
"Join Google Meet," both specified for IITM students only, suggesting support
or communication channels for the platform. **Login Information Area:** *
**Login Status:** "You are logged in as 21f2000588@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." This
displays the user's email address and indicates they are authenticated. *
**Logout Button:** Provides an option to end the session. **Recent Saves
Section:** * **Heading:** "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)"
This explains the purpose of this section. * **List of Saves:** Displays a
history of saved attempts, including the date and time of each save and the
corresponding score. * "Reload" button for each save entry. * The entries
include: * "Reload from 3/2/2025, 1:21:26 PM. Score: 10" * "Reload from

9" **Questions Section:** * **Heading:** "Questions" * **Question 1:** "Write
a FastAPI proxy server (1 mark)" This indicates a coding question worth 1
point. * The mention of "FastAPI" shows that this question might be related to
coding a web server in python. **General Features:** * **Color Scheme:** Dark
background with green accents in the header and "Recent Saves" section. * The
overall design indicates a professional and streamlined web interface. This
detailed description should help answer questions about the image, such as the
type of platform, the user's progress, available resources, and the nature of
the assessment. ]TDS_ROE_10marks_visible_image1280×661 70.2

### Abhiram_Gudivada (2025-03-02T09:08:17.083Z)

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the
save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and
by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.  
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other
questions for extra marks.  
Could you please consider my request?  
Thank you.

### S Smriti (2025-03-02T09:16:19.544Z)

Major betrayal - laptop, shut down like 5 times during the test losing 10
solid minutes, i think we should have atleast 1 hour from next term onwards

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a web browser
displaying results from an online exam or test. The browser window shows a URL
at the top, and the primary content area displays information about the exam
status and recent saves. **Header Section (Red Background):** * **Text:**
"Ended at Sun, 2 Mar, 2025, 1:45 pm IST" - This indicates the exam has
concluded and specifies the date and time of its ending. The time is given in
Indian Standard Time (IST). * **Text:** "Score: 0" - The header section also
displays a score of 0, implying that the final score achieved on the exam is
zero. * **Text:** "Check a..."- A button labelled to check something. **Main
Content Area (Dark Background):** * **Heading:** "Recent saves (most recent is
your official score)" - This heading introduces a list of saved exam attempts,
with an important note that the most recent save is considered the official
score. * **List of Saves:** A list of saves is shown, with each entry
containing: * A button labelled "Reload." * The text "from 3/2/2025," followed
by a timestamp (e.g., "1:41:37 PM"). This indicates when the save was made. *
The text "Score: 10" - This represents the score achieved at the time of the
save. **Observations:** * There are multiple saves listed, all with a score of
10. However, the overall "Score: 0" at the top suggests that the most recent
save was not properly recorded, or a different scoring system was used at the
end of the exam. * The timestamps on the saves are very close to each other
(within a few seconds), implying multiple saves were made around the same
time. * The URL "exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-roe" suggests the exam is
hosted on a development server. ]image633×512 23.8

Sir, I’m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of
10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the
highest marks from recent saves.

Charging wasnt an issue for me, my entire vsc just froze and the screen went

was trying to get the output and it froze, reopened at 1:45 and the time was
up

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-03-03T09:57:39.017Z)

Hi [@21f3002158](/u/21f3002158)

I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit
button throughout the exam.

Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using
save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.

There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with
this.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir, I got disconnected at around
1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab
which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple
scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question
4 on vs code and Collab and finally got the answer but I exceeded the time
limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to
please consider that  
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process

Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image's content:
**Overall Layout and Theme:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a web

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and
eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications
were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped

Hi [@23f2004781](/u/23f2004781)

I looked for your submissions in backend and can’t find any submission.

[Image could not be described] 23f2004781:

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE
day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support
meet before deadline.

Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you
created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help
with it.

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions
but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I
have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not
saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved
my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before
1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i
request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i
have my exams tomorrow.

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal)

Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only.
There is no way we can validate it after deadline.

I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before
deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

Kind regards

### Jayesh Bansal (2025-03-03T11:09:03.641Z)

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by
hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am
asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline
which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by
being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if
you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test
to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min
which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-03-03T11:14:55.051Z)

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal)

After deadline we gave allowance for 2 minutes considering network issues
students might have faced, so till 1:47:00 all submissions will be considered
valid, after that we won’t take any submissions.

Following are your submissions all of them were after deadline

Quiz | Email | Time | Total | Max  
---|---|---|---|---  
tds-2025-01-roe | roe-24f1001895@ds.study.iitm.ac.in | 2025-03-02 19:29:49 | 9 | 10

### Muthupalaniappan (2025-03-03T11:18:47.995Z)

Hello sir, [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Do you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then?


---
### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-03-03T11:22:18.529Z)

Yes, it won’t be considered.


---
### Jayesh Bansal (2025-03-03T11:23:18.046Z)

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post
submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in
approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before
only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for
1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any
one of the saves except the first save


---
### Jivraj Singh Shekhawat (2025-03-03T11:26:28.141Z)

Sorry [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal) All your submissions were around 7
hours after 1:47:00 Pm, that’s why we won’t consider them for evaluation.

Kind regards

Hi [@23f3002537](/u/23f3002537)  
The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting
the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response
instead of the json. Here is the revised version.

    
    
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
    from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
    import httpx
    import uvicorn
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    # Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["*"],
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )
    
    @app.get("/api")
    async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
        headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
        try:
            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                response = await client.get(url)
                return response.json()
        except httpx.RequestError as e:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

### Muthupalaniappan (2025-03-03T11:41:40.027Z)

Hello [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the
technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the
technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.

I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can
ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.

Please re consider this request sir.

### Yogesh (2025-03-03T11:43:46.470Z)

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) Could you please verify if my score will be accepted by
you? I saved only once: at 1:47 pm. My roll number is 21f2001573.

Probably, by this week


---
### Saransh Saini (2025-03-03T15:11:08.338Z)

I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace
period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past
1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.  
Regards


---
### Yogesh (2025-03-03T15:33:40.982Z)

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save.
In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with
the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).

Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not
considered.

I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.

Please reconsider if possible.

please look into this and revert

---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-08T15:26:32.251Z)

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some
problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We
are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded.
Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected
so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to
be implemented.

### D HARICHARAN  (2025-03-09T08:19:00.292Z)

Respected Sir,

I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a
bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE
on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed
until 1:47 PM.

Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about
the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my
initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I
was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that
students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks
when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.

Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still
achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also
everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same
manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my
mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had
conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a
standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to
unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.

Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks
still got submitted  
rollnumber 23f2001390

The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would
be considered.
