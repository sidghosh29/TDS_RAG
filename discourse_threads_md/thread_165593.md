In the discussion Thread for Project 1, it was said that there will be live
sessions conducted for the project, however, there hasnâ€™t been one
specifically for it.

If there are live sessions that will be conducted, can we have some hands on
tutorial for the project ?

Hi Sakthivel,

We are still covering the precursors for Project. Once we cover the required
topics then we will have sessions that work through the project with the
students.

Kind regards
