Dear Sir,

I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the
ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.

I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing
this issue

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware
that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my
dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”

I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a
backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly
look into this and confirm?

Thank you

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a webpage or
application interface. It shows a user's login status, a logout button, and a
section displaying recent saves. **Text Content:** * **Login Status:** "You
are logged in as 23f2005141@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." This indicates the user is
successfully logged in and displays their username/email address. * **Logout
Button:** The word "Logout" is displayed within a rectangular button. *
**Recent Saves Section:** The section is labeled "Recent saves" with a
parenthetical note: "(most recent is your official score)". This suggests that
the list shows the history of saved states or attempts, and the most recent
entry reflects the user's official score. * **Save History Entries:** There
are three entries in the "Recent saves" section, each with a similar
structure: * A "Reload" button (likely a functional button for reloading that
specific save state). * The text "from" followed by a date and time, such as
"3/2/2025, 1:51:06 PM". * The text "Score:" followed by a numerical score, in
this case, "6" for all three entries. **Visual Elements:** * **Colors:** The
image uses a color scheme with white background, green for the recent saves
area, blue for the "Reload" buttons and red for the logout button. *
**Buttons:** The presence of "Reload" and "Logout" suggests these are
interactive buttons. * **Font:** The font appears to be a standard sans-serif
font. * **Alignment:** The text is generally left-aligned within its
respective sections. **Interpretation:** The image shows a user interface
where a user is logged in, can log out, and can see a history of their recent
saves with their corresponding scores. The most recent save is highlighted as
the official score.]image475×307 8.78 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the

was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)

I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the
time limit.

My roll number is 24F1001631.  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image is a screenshot of a section from a software or
game interface, likely related to saving progress. It appears as a dark green
rectangle, likely part of a larger menu or settings panel. The background is a
dark, slightly textured green. **Text Elements:** * **"Recent saves"** is the
primary heading, indicating this section deals with saved game states or
progress. The text is white and stands out against the green background. *
**(most recent is your official score)** is a smaller, parenthetical phrase
following "Recent saves". It suggests the latest save is the one considered
for scoring purposes. * Each save entry has this format: * A button labeled
**"Reload"** in a light blue box. * The word **"from"** followed by a date. In
this image, there are three entries all for **"3/2/2025"**. * A specific time
of the save. The times are **"2:14:14 PM", "2:08:38 PM",** and **"1:43:45
PM"**. * The text **"Score:"** followed by a numerical score. The scores are
**"9", "8"** and **"6"**. **Graphical Elements:** * The "Reload" buttons are
presented as simple rectangular boxes with light blue borders and white text.
* The layout is clean and organized, with each save entry clearly separated
from the others. **Interpretation:** The image shows a list of recent save
points, likely ordered from most recent to least recent. Each entry displays
the date and time of the save, along with a score associated with that save
state. The "Reload" buttons suggest you can load any of these save states to
resume gameplay from that point. The parenthetical note at the top emphasizes
the most recent save is the official score.]image1430×253 11

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-09T14:05:15.712Z)

We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students
affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by
operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right
scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores
over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are
batch processed it will happen over night during a server update.

Bottom line: wait till Tuesday  
Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then.  
If not let us know

Kind regards.

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a course
information panel, likely from an online learning platform. It's divided into
a header section, a list of assignments/assessments, and a call-to-action
button. **Header Section:** * **Title:** "Tools in Data Science" in a larger,
bold font. * **Subtitle:** "NEW COURSE" appears beneath the title in a
slightly smaller font. * **Background:** The header has a dark reddish-brown
background with a subtle pattern of dark spots, possibly to give it texture.
**Assignments/Assessments List:** * **Week Assignments:** A list of
assignments, each labeled by week (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5),
followed by "Assignment" and then a score of "100.00." It suggests that the
user received a perfect score on all weekly assignments. * **Programming
Quiz:** "PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1 - Absent" indicates that the user either missed or
did not complete this quiz. **Call-to-Action Button:** * A button at the
bottom of the panel, with the text "Go to Course page >". It is likely a link
to the main course page. **General Observations:** * The text is in a dark
gray or black color against a light gray background. * The image suggests a
user's progress or status within a "Tools in Data Science" course. * The
perfect scores on the weekly assignments contrast with the "Absent" status on
the quiz, potentially indicating an issue with the quiz completion.

Hi Team, I have appeared for ROE TDS 2025 and have secured 3 marks, but my
score is shown as zero in the dashboard.

Please clarify.  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout and Context:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a
student's online course dashboard or a similar interface. The title at the top
reads "My Current Courses." Below the title, there are two lines of text
indicating the student's Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and Project
CGPA for the term. **CGPA Information:** * Cumulative Grade Point Average
(CGPA) till this term - **7.8** * Project Cumulative Grade Point Average
(Project CGPA) till this term - **0.0** **Course Modules:** The main part of
the image shows two course modules, arranged side by side. 1\. **Left Module:
Business Data Management** * **Course Title:** Business Data Management *
**Status:** REPEAT FULL COURSE (This likely indicates the student is retaking
the course.) * **Assignments:** * Week 1 Assignment - 25.00 * Week 2
Assignment - 50.00 * **Call to Action:** Go to Course page > 2\. **Right
Module: Tools in Data Science** * **Course Title:** Tools in Data Science *
**Status:** NEW COURSE (This likely indicates that the student is taking the
course for the first time) * **Assignments:** * Week 1 Assignment - 35.00 *
Week 2 Assignment - 45.00 * Week 3 Assignment - 0.00 * Week 4 Assignment -
20.00 * Week 5 Assignment - 50.00 * **Programming Quiz:** * PROGRAMMING QUIZ 1
- Absent * **Call to Action:** Go to Course page > **Visual Elements:** * Each
course module has a dark background with a subtle, dotted design. * The text
is mostly white or light-colored for contrast against the dark background. *
The "Go to Course page" is a call to action. **In summary, the image shows a
student's course dashboard with two courses, their CGPA information,
assignment details for each course, and clear calls to action to navigate to
the course pages.** ]image930×584 42.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-
