Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns
include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series
ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could
someone please assist me with this?  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Structure:** The image shows a spreadsheet, likely from a program
like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. The sheet contains data related to PPI
(Producer Price Index) industry data, presented in a structured format. There
are two distinct sets of data, separated by a horizontal line. Each set
describes different pharmaceutical preparations. **First Data Set (Rows
1-7):** * **Row 1:** Contains the descriptive text "PPI industry data for
Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and
digitalis preparations, not seasonally adjusted". * **Row 2 (Series Title):**
Repeats the description from Row 1. * **Row 3 (Series ID):** Contains the code
"PCU3254123254127111". * **Row 4 (Seasonality):** Specifies "Not Seasonally
Adjusted". * **Row 5 (Survey Name):** Indicates "PPI Industry Data". * **Row 6
(Measure Data):** Specifies "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis
preparations". * **Row 7 (Industry):** Identifies the industry as
"Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing". * **Row 8 (Item):**
"Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations". **Second Data Set
(Rows 10-16):** * **Row 10:** Contains the descriptive text "PPI industry data
for Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing-Calcium channel blockers, not
seasonally adjusted". * **Row 11 (Series Title):** Repeats the description
from Row 10. * **Row 12 (Series ID):** Contains the code
"PCU3254123254127114". * **Row 13 (Seasonality):** Specifies "Not Seasonally
Adjusted". * **Row 14 (Survey Name):** Indicates "PPI Industry Data". * **Row
15 (Measure Data):** Specifies "Calcium channel blockers". * **Row 16
(Industry):** Identifies the industry as "Pharmaceutical preparation
manufacturing". * **Row 17 (Item):** "Calcium channel blockers". **Key
Features:** * **Consistent Data Structure:** Both data sets follow the same
format with labels like "Series Title", "Series ID", "Seasonality", "Survey
Name", "Measure Data", "Industry", and "Item". * **Pharmaceutical Focus:** All
data relates to the "Pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing" industry. *
**Different Preparations:** The two data sets differentiate between
"Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations" and "Calcium channel
blockers". * **Not Seasonally Adjusted:** Both data sets are explicitly stated
as "Not Seasonally Adjusted", which is a key characteristic. * **Series ID:**
Specific codes are given as the Series ID to refer to these pharmaceutical
preparations. ]image1393×657 67.8 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image's content:
**Overall Layout:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a question within
a larger form or document, possibly related to a course or assignment. The
layout is simple and structured, with a title, scenario description,
instructions, and a highlighted section for file downloads. **Textual
Information:** * **Question Title:** "Question 7.1" * **Scenario:** The
scenario describes a political party, Buddhi Daya Nyaay (BDN), analyzing the
impact of pharmaceutical exports from India to the US on India's economy.
India's pharmaceutical exports to the US for Fiscal Year 2024 reached
₹2,42,888 Crores. The task involves creating an insightful analysis using
provided CSV files. * **Provided Files:** Two downloadable files are listed: *
Industry Product Segment Information * Monthly Price Indices for Segments
(Two-year data) (This is highlighted with a gray background in the original
image.) * **Tasks (Instructions):** A series of steps are outlined for the
user to complete: 1\. Create a new blank Google Sheet workbook named
"ga.7.1.rollno" (replacing "rollno" with the user's IITM roll number,
excluding the domain). 2\. Share the Google Sheet with editing rights to the
email address "se2002@study.iitm.ac.in". Failure to do this on a blank
workbook will result in the submission not being considered. 3\. Important
note to make sure sheet names are exactly as given in the instructions below.
4\. "Sheet1" should contain columns: Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value.
5\. "Sheet2" should create a pivot table with Item as rows, Year and Month as
columns (hierarchically stacked), and Value as values. **Highlights and
Emphasis:** * The provided file "Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year
data)" is highlighted in gray in the original image. * "NOTE: Make sure the
sheet names are exactly as given below:" is emphasized in bold. * The
instructions concerning renaming and sharing the Google Sheet workbook are
also highlighted in bold. **Overall Impression:** The image represents a data
analysis task focused on the pharmaceutical industry, likely part of an
academic assignment. The instructions are precise, and the provided files
suggest a practical application of data analysis skills. The emphasis on
correct naming conventions and sharing permissions indicates the importance of
following instructions carefully for grading or assessment purposes.

Below items don’t have prices.

PCU3254123254127111 | Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations  
---|---  
PCU3254123254127114 | Calcium channel blockers  
PCU325412325412MM | Miscellaneous receipts  
PCU325412325412D112OC | Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter  
PCU325412325412D113 | Antacids  
PCU325412325412SS | Secondary products  
PCU3254123254127112 | ACE inhibitors  
  
Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.  
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024
December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Can you please advise regarding the ga.7.2 as the The
current top 5 countries by GDP in 2014 from the dataset are actually
aggregated economic groups (not individual countries). can i proceed with that
or I need to filter only the individual countries

Hi Tanya,

Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just
the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.

Kind regards


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-27T02:51:40.362Z)

The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this
question, not aggregated economic groups.

### Shambhavi  (2025-04-09T16:17:47.791Z)

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer
review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the
initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this
particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?  

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Image:** The image is a screenshot of a Gmail inbox within a web
browser. It shows a list of emails with subjects related to "peer review" or
"TDS (presumably a course code) GA 7". The Gmail interface is visible with
standard elements like the search bar, navigation options (Mail,
Conversations, Spaces), and email list. **Key Text Elements:** * **Search
Bar:** Contains the text "peer review", indicating that the inbox is filtered
to show emails containing these keywords. * **Email Subjects/Content:** * "TDS
Jan 2025 - GA 7 Review - GA 7 Review Here's what was received." * "BONUS 5
Marks to T Score - submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for
your submission." * "GA 7 Peer allocations - submit 3 peer evaluations, so
that you may be graded for your submission." * **Attachment Filenames:** *
"23f3003944.html" (appears twice) * "23f3001178.html" * "23f2001738.html" *
"24f1002555.html" * "23f1001126.html" **Visual Features:** * **Email List:**
Shows two email entries from "22t1 se2002" (likely a student/user identifier)
related to course assignments. * **Attachments:** The emails have attachments
with filenames ending in ".html". The file name "23f3003944.html" is circled
in pink to draw attention to it. * **Dates:** One email is dated "5:25 PM",
and another is dated "Apr 1". * **Interface Icons:** Standard Gmail icons for
Mail, Conversations, Spaces, filters, settings, etc., are visible. * **IIT
Madras Logo:** An IIT Madras logo is visible at the top right corner.
**Inferences:** * The user is likely a student at IIT Madras, possibly
enrolled in a course or assignment related to "TDS GA 7." * The "peer review"
and email subjects indicate that the emails are related to peer evaluations or
assessments for the course. * The "BONUS 5 Marks" email suggests that
submitting peer evaluations could earn the student extra credit. * The HTML
attachments are probably web forms used to submit the peer evaluations. In
short, the image provides a snapshot of a student's Gmail inbox at IIT Madras.
The emails relate to peer evaluation submissions for a course or assignment.

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-09T17:20:35.560Z)

Hi Shambhavi, Thanks for the update. We will look into it.

Thanks once again


---
### Shambhavi  (2025-04-10T07:14:42.624Z)

Sir,  
In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would
have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However,
if others have marked it differently based on their available information,
there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the
permissible variance limit of ±33%.

In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?

Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard
marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This
would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies
arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening
currently.


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-10T07:32:35.000Z)

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the
html file. It’s in the peers interest **and** yours. That’s an important
aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.  
Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the
messiness is to communicate with one another.


---
### Dhruv Agrawal (2025-04-11T05:26:32.693Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
sir can you please clarify what do we have to write in google form if there is
no submission?


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-04-11T05:48:24.000Z)

You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email
address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero
because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
