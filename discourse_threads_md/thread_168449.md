Dear Learner

Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:

[Image could not be described]
[exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

### [Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is
45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.  
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the
solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of
ROE).  
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the
console.

    
    
    inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
    textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
    buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
    inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
    buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
    textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
    

Do not submit or save your answers.

All the best!  
Kind regards  
TDS Team

### Update 2

#### 26/02/2025 11:00 am

We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).  
The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek
Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.

We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular
teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a
real preview of what ROE looks like).

Kind regards,  
TDS Team

* * *

### Update 1

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Content:**
The image shows the Google "G" logo. It is a stylized capital "G" that uses
the primary Google colors: blue, red, yellow, and green. **Key Features:** *
**Shape:** The logo is a circular shape, likely intended to be used as an icon
or favicon. * **Colors:** The colors are arranged to visually break down the
"G" into segments. * **Style:** The logo appears to be a pixelated or low-
resolution version of the standard Google "G" logo. In summary, it is a
simple, recognizable logo of the company Google.] [Google
Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en-US/products/calendar/)

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on
text, objects, and relevant features: **Overall Impression:** The image
appears to be a promotional or illustrative graphic showcasing the Google
Workspace calendar and meeting features. It presents a clean, modern interface
with a focus on scheduling, collaboration, and video conferencing. **Key
Elements and Details:** * **Calendar Interface:** The core of the image
displays a digital calendar view. * Days: Individual days (Tuesday 21,
Wednesday 22, Thursday 23, Friday 24) are arranged horizontally, likely
representing a week view. * Day Highlight: Wednesday, the 22nd, is emphasized
with a blue circle, suggesting a particular date or event of interest. * Mini
Calendar: A small, traditional calendar grid is also present, showing the
month with the 22nd highlighted in blue. * **Event and Task Scheduling:** The
calendar is populated with events and tasks represented as colored blocks or
labels. Some examples include: * "Order Stationary" * "Follow Up" (at 8:30 AM)
* "Finalize Presentation" * "Submit Reimbursement" * "Team Meeting" (from 11
AM to 12 PM) * "Lunch with Lucy" (at 12 PM) * "Focus time" (from 8 AM to 10
AM) * **Meeting Details Pop-up:** A prominent "Team Meeting" event is shown
with a pop-up window providing more details. * "Join with Google Meet": A
clear call to action to start or join the meeting via Google Meet. * "3
Guests": Indicates the number of attendees invited to the meeting. * Guest
List: Depictions of three people's profile pictures. * Attachments: Labels
indicate potentially attached files, such as "Expenses" and "Pitch Deck". *
RSVP Options: "Going?" options are presented as "Yes," "No," and "Maybe". *
**Video Conference Screen:** A tablet or display showing a live video
conference feed is included. * Person on Video: A man wearing glasses is
displayed, looking directly at the camera. * Meeting Controls: Icons at the
bottom suggest typical video conference controls (mute, camera, share screen,
leave). * **Task Management Panel:** At the upper left, there is a
notification of follow-up event scheduled for January 22, with the option to
accept by clicking "Yes". **Text and Branding:** * "Google Workspace": The
Google Workspace logo and name are prominently displayed, reinforcing the
product's identity. **Overall Interpretation:** The image is designed to
convey how Google Workspace tools can facilitate effective scheduling, task
management, and remote collaboration, particularly highlighting the
integration between Google Calendar and Google Meet for seamless video
conferencing.]

### Sagandeep Kaur (2025-02-25T14:44:59.458Z)

After seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam,
anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult.

where can we find link for recording of live session which happened after this
mock roe ?  
thanks

### Shashannk (2025-02-26T03:30:22.514Z)

dear [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
when will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube?


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-02-26T03:58:19.216Z)

[@23f2003413](/u/23f2003413)

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real
time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get
you to realise some key things:

  1. The chaos of ROE.
  2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
  3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
  4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
  5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**
  6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
  7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
  8. How limited the time is.

The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students
felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so
that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But
this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the
discussions were very intense even for us.

Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with
new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without
a time limit).

I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise
to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure.
The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used
to the clock.

Kind regards

### Shubham Atkal (2025-02-26T09:16:29.955Z)

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir , for me given constituency was `"SRI
GOBINDPUR"`  
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over
the period names were changed of this constituency  
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab

    
    
    df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]
    

is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only?
but then this constituency is not availble after 1957

using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR

[drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

###
[df_gobindpur.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

Google Drive file.

then i used margin formula as

    
    
    margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100
    

using this i got answer for 1st question as

    
    
    YEAR                              1992
    AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
    WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
    WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
    WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
    RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
    RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
    RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
    MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114
    

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were
assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data
for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two
are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in
the dataset?

Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set
of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price.

What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Round to 2
decimal places (e.g. 123.40).

                    table["Type"] = table["Type"].str.strip().str.lower()
                    gold_sales = table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Units"] * table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Price"]
                    total_sales += gold_sales.sum()

@all  
Q: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find
the shortest path between `Doha` and `Muscat`.

World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific
cities. The distance between two cities is the [Haversine
distance](https://pypi.org/project/haversine/).

What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total
distance traveled?

Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas.

Sir, Can we get these live sessions recorded on YouTube


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-02-26T16:59:06.630Z)

We are expecting you to collaborate. But you got to do it in a methodical
organised way. Like NASA trying to get the 3 men in Apollo 13 back home.
:wink:  
Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a
hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it.

Kind regards


---
### Trebhuvan SB (2025-02-26T17:05:34.194Z)

But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people
just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer
instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about
the “collaborating” thing.


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-02-26T17:13:24.279Z)

I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it
with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At
some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There
is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical
thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer
critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I
lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has
to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know
the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me.

Kind regards

### Sagandeep Kaur (2025-02-26T17:34:47.287Z)

Thanks, today’s mock was manageable unlike yesterday’s one. I got some correct
within 45 minutes, but yesterday, I couldn’t even complete scraping.


---
### Trebhuvan SB (2025-02-26T17:40:08.801Z)

I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and
proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used)
could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA
questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the
topics which are covered.

But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to
this :sweat_smile:


---
### Trebhuvan SB (2025-02-26T17:46:13.166Z)

There was no need to scrape Sagan, you could have copied the whole table and
pasted it into an excel sheet and exported it as a csv file. Try it out once!

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall
Structure:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a question-answering
interface, likely related to patents. It shows two questions, labeled "Q1" and
"Q2," within a larger "patent questions" section. Each question has an option
to "Start coding or generate with AI," suggesting an interactive element where
users can get assistance in finding answers. **Detailed Analysis of Q1:** *
**Question Text:** "Given a dataset Which patent(s) have the highest number of
claims? Cite the patent ID. If you have multiple patents with the same number
of claims, list them all separated by commas without spaces." *
**Instruction:** The question instructs the user to identify patent(s) with
the maximum number of claims from a given dataset. It specifies that if
multiple patents share the highest claim count, their IDs should be listed,
separated by commas without any spaces. * **Explanation:** "The parameter file
without the extension is assumed as the Patent ID.E.g. For the below data
Patent ID is US20230225250A1-20230720." This clarifies the identification of a
patent ID within the dataset context. It gives an example of a patent ID
US20230225250A1-20230720 **Detailed Analysis of Q2:** * **Question Text:**
There is no information **Important Considerations:** * **"dataset"
(hyperlink):** The word "dataset" is likely a hyperlink. This indicates that
the patent information to be analyzed is accessible through this link. *
**Interactive Elements:** The "Start coding or generate with AI" phrases
suggest interactive elements where users can get assistance in finding
answers. **In essence, the image presents a query-based task related to patent
data analysis. The task requires identifying patents with the maximum number
of claims from a dataset and presenting their IDs in a specific
format.**]image1284×729 51.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

Question 2 of the patent questions is missing, is it intentional?

[@trebhuvansb](/u/trebhuvansb)

There is only 1 patent question. Intentional, its hard enough to do all
questions


---
### Trebhuvan SB (2025-02-27T16:33:17.296Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
How many questions will we be having in our ROE?  
Because I remember Anand sir mentioning 17 questions in the explanation of the
difficulty of the ROE


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-02-27T16:58:54.635Z)

It completely depends on the ROE. There is just no reasonable way of knowing
how many questions ROE will have. If there is only 1 question, I would be very
worried.

Kind regards

### ABHIJIT PADHI (2025-02-28T02:27:58.915Z)

access the exam.


---
### Trebhuvan SB (2025-02-28T04:47:55.392Z)

I thought the mocks would be a representation of the actual ROE and the mocks
had 6 questions so I assumed 6 questions.


---
### Saransh Saini (2025-02-28T05:13:09.507Z)

Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you
comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the
real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the
mocks.

### LAKSHAY (2025-02-28T05:46:42.888Z)

Respected [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) ,
[@carlton](/u/carlton)

Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending
the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries,
whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in
place, which naturally reduces your solving time.

As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared
and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain
any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been
modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we
have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our
grades are not put at undue risk.

I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort
to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is
simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I
sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a
reasonable relief.

Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Best Regards,  
Lakshay

---
### Shivaditya Bhattacharya (2025-02-28T08:15:02.357Z)

Yeah especially if the system is slow, it takes too much time to download
libraries. Colab provides more RAM but it frequently stops runtime and
restarting it again is very time-consuming.

[[Image description: The image is a screenshot of a prompt engineering
challenge, likely within a cybersecurity or AI security context. Here's a
breakdown: * **Header Text:** "SecurePrompt Technologies is a cybersecurity
firm..." This sets the context. The challenge is about testing the security of
large language models (LLMs) against adversarial prompts. The company enforces
strict policies on its LLMs. * **Task Description:** The core task is
outlined. The user is interacting with an LLM that is explicitly programmed to
*never* say "Yes". The user needs to find a prompt that will force the LLM to
output the word "Yes." This is a challenge of bypassing the model's internal
constraints. * **Instruction:** "Use your AI Proxy token when prompted." *
**Prompt Box:** A dark gray box indicates where the user should enter their
prompt. * **Grading Criteria:** "As long as the LLM says the word Yes (case
sensitive), you will be marked correct." This highlights that the output needs
to *exactly* include the word "Yes" (case sensitive). There's also a note that
the challenge might change. In essence, the image presents a prompt
engineering problem focused on instruction following and security
vulnerabilities in LLMs. The user is tasked with breaking the LLM's "no 'Yes'"
rule. ]image1595×597 89.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-04T10:15:32.857Z)

The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its
a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was
basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in
the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some
जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when
you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem
what they are.

:wink:
