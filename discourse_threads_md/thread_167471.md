Dear TDS Team,

I have verified my submission, and my repository **does include a Dockerfile**
, and the **Docker image is accessible on DockerHub**. Please find the
attached screenshot as proof. Kindly review my submission again and let me
know if any further action is needed.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,

[[Image description: The image shows a file directory listing in a dark-themed
environment. The directory contains a mix of folders and files, possibly
related to a programming project. Folders: * `..` (Parent directory) *
`LLM_PROJECT1` * `__pycache__` Files: * `Dockerfile` * `LICENSE` * `app.py` *
`datagen.py` * `evaluate.py` * `requirements.txt` * `tasksA.py` * `tasksB.py`
Based on the file names, the project likely involves Python programming (`.py`
files) and could be related to Large Language Models (LLM), suggested by the
folder name `LLM_PROJECT1` and file names like `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`,
`tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py`. The `requirements.txt` file indicates that the
project likely uses external Python libraries. The presence of a `Dockerfile`
suggests that the project is designed to be containerized and run in a Docker
environment. The `LICENSE` file indicates that the project has some form of
licensing information.]image250×534 3.92 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

[[Image description: Here's a description of the content in the image: *
**Main Text:** The image shows the text "arnavmehta2025/llm\\_project1" in a
prominent, white font. This likely represents a username and a project name. *
**Attribution:** Below this, it says "By arnavmehta2025". This indicates the
creator or owner of the project. The username is hyperlinked. * **Update
Information:** The text "Updated 2 days ago" is also present, likely
indicating the last time the project was modified. * **Descriptor:** The word
"IMAGE" is present in a box, suggesting that the project involves image-
related content. * **Icon:** To the left of the text, there's an icon of a
stylized cube or package. This visually represents the project in some way.
The cube has two parallel lines on one of its faces. * **Stars/Downloads:**
There is a star symbol followed by "0", and a down arrow symbol followed by
"16". This likely indicates the number of "stars" or likes received by the
project and the number of downloads. * **Color Scheme:** The image has a dark
color scheme with white/light text, indicating a dark mode
interface.]image713×238 11 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

Good Morning Sir,  
Sir even I am facing a similar issue, even though sanity check for docker
image on docker hub was cleared but got a mail saying ‘dockerfile’ not present
in the GitHub repo while it clearly was. Sir please look into it we have given
so many days to complete this project.

Looking forward to your reply.

Thank you

So the reason for the failure is:

You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main
instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM)

Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements
and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for
students to make the necessary corrections.

Then once you realised your mistake, on **Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST** i.e
_yesteday_ , you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.

Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647,
post:1, topic:167471”]  

[[Image description: The image shows a file directory structure. Here's a
breakdown: * **Folders:** * `..` (likely indicating the parent directory) *
`LLM_PROJECT1` * `__pycache__` * **Files:** * `Dockerfile` * `LICENSE` *
`app.py` * `datagen.py` * `evaluate.py` * `requirements.txt` * `tasksA.py` *
`tasksB.py` The presence of `app.py`, `datagen.py`, `evaluate.py`,
`tasksA.py`, and `tasksB.py` suggests a Python project. The `requirements.txt`
file likely lists the dependencies for the project. `Dockerfile` is for
containerization (Docker). `LICENSE` is for licensing information for the
project. The `LLM_PROJECT1` folder suggests that this project is likely a
large language model (LLM) related project.]image250×534 3.92

showing that your files are in the correct place.

We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the
deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir  
Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and
submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure
if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.

I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email
later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I
was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised
my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if
my submission could still be considered :frowning:

Kind regards,

Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in
Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it
was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you
autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change
even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it
was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.

Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a
resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just
that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too
“Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have
already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.

Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.

Warm Regards,

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image, focusing on
the text, objects, and relevant features: **Overall Appearance:** * The image
shows a file explorer or a file management interface, likely from a code
repository or a development environment. * The interface has a dark theme. *
Files and folders are listed with their names, descriptions, and timestamps
indicating the last time they were modified. **File and Folder Listing:** *
**Business (Folder):** * Description: "Reconfigured taskB8 taskB9 taskB10" *
Last Modified: "2 days ago" * **Operations (Folder):** * Description:
"Reconfigured taskA8 taskA9 taskA10" * Last Modified: "2 days ago" * **app
(Folder):** * Description: "Updated Dockerfile and requirements.txt" * Last
Modified: "2 days ago" * **Dockerfile (File):** * Description: "Rename
dockerfile to Dockerfile" * Last Modified: "yesterday" * **LICENSE (File):** *
Description: "MIT License" * Last Modified: "3 days ago" * **README.md
(File):** * Description: "Project Structure" * Last Modified: "3 days ago"
**Icons:** * Folders are represented by a folder icon. * Files are represented
by a document icon (with a folded corner). * Icons are gray. **Right
Sidebar:** * A vertical sidebar is visible on the right side of the image with
what appear to be additional icons, but the specific functions of these icons
are not clear without further context. One icon could be an equalizer or
adjustment tool. Another looks like a heart or star, perhaps for favoriting.
**Overall Impression:** The image depicts the file structure of a project,
showing that there have been recent updates to the project within the last few
days. Folders relate to "Business," "Operations," and an "app," and there are
standard files like a Dockerfile, LICENSE, and README.md. ]Screenshot
