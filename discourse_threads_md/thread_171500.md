Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer
reviews are done.  
(roughly 3 days before end term).

Kind regards

What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are
required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We can’t leave it blank.

Just put zero there. Since all the quantitative answers are positive.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer
review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the
initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this
particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?
