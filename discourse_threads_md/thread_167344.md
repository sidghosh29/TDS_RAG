[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: The image
features a Scottish Fold cat standing on its hind legs on a wooden floor. The
cat has a white belly and chest, with gray and black stripes along its back
and on its head. The cat has a light pink nose and bright green eyes. Its ears
are folded downward, a characteristic of the Scottish Fold breed. The cat's
paws are close to its mouth, giving the impression that it is praying or
pleading. The background is a light brown wooden floor. The image is well-lit
and has a somewhat soft focus.]88394c0c2e80a1326cfffe020684be4a480×270 10.3

It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time
should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments.

There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py
was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected
outcome.

The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation
guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card
number from the image is a sensitive information.

I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.

Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking
the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed. :grinning:
