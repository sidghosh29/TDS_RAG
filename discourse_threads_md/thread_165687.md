I will be at the IIT Madras campus next Wednesday (5 Feb) from 10:30 am to
2:30 pm IST.

I’ll be at the NAC (New Academic Complex) or the NAC footsteps.

If anyone would like to chat - about TDS, or anything else - you’re welcome.

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Layout:** * The image is a text-based profile, likely from a website or
document. * It features a large title, followed by a smaller subtitle, a
profile heading, and paragraphs detailing information. **Text Content:** *
**Title:** "Anand S." (Prominently displayed, likely the name of the
individual being profiled.) * **Subtitle:** "CEO, Gramener" (Indicates the
person's current role and company affiliation.) * **Profile Heading:**
"Profile" (Underlined in maroon color, indicating the section that follows is
about Anand S.'s background and activities.) * **Profile Text:** * "Anand is a
co-founder of Gramener, a data science company. He leads a team that tells
visual stories from data. He is recognized as one of India's top 10 scientists
and is a regular TEDx speaker." * "Anand is a gold medallist from IIM
Bangalore and an alumnus of IIT Madras, London Business School, IBM, Infosys
Consulting, Lehman Brothers, and BCG." * "More importantly, he has hand-
transcribed every Calvin & Hobbes strip ever, is addicted to Minecraft (thanks
to his daughter), and dreams of watching every film on the IMDb Top 250
(except The Shining)." * "He blogs at s-anand.net. His talks are at
bit.ly/anandtalks" **Key Features:** * The profile seems to be structured to
highlight both professional accomplishments and personal interests. * The
language is relatively informal, especially in the "More importantly" section,
which suggests a more personable tone. * There are several links/URLs
included: "s-anand.net" (blog) and "bit.ly/anandtalks" (talks). In summary,
the image is a profile of Anand S., who is the CEO of Gramener, a data science
company. The profile covers his professional achievements, education,
recognition as a scientist, speaking engagements, and personal interests like
Calvin & Hobbes, Minecraft, and films. It also provides links to his blog and
talks. ]Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 3.07.09 pm1300×850 81.3
