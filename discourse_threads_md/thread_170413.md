[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Content:**
The image shows a close-up of two hands rapidly typing on a glowing keyboard.
The hands are fair-skinned and somewhat blurred due to the motion, suggesting
fast typing speed. A ring is visible on one of the fingers. **Details:** *
**Hands:** The hands are the central focus. They are in motion, pressing down
on the keys. * **Keyboard:** The keyboard is illuminated with a blue/purple
glow, which highlights the keys. The keys themselves appear to be translucent,
allowing the light to shine through. * **Background:** The background is dark
and out of focus, emphasizing the illuminated keyboard and the hands.
**Overall Impression:** The image conveys a sense of urgency, speed, and
possibly technology-related activity. The illuminated keyboard adds a visual
appeal and might suggest a scene from a movie or show involving computers or
hacking.]  
Kind regards,  
_TDS Team_

[ [Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: The image
appears to be a screenshot taken during a Google Meet video conference. In the
foreground, there is a man with graying hair and a serious expression. He is
wearing a headset with a microphone positioned near his mouth. His shirt is a
light, possibly gray, color. In the background, there is a plain white wall.
On the wall, to the left of the man, is an electrical outlet. There is also a
subtle, faded pattern or decoration visible on the wall to the right of the
man. In the top right corner, there is a Google Meet logo. At the bottom left
corner, the name "Anand S" is displayed, presumably identifying the man in the
video conference. The overall lighting in the room appears somewhat diffused.]
