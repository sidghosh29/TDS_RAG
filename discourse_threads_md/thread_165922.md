Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than
installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require
multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work
on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual
environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.

Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install
packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My
understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt
file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version
ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a
specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the
requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases,
wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?

That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency
requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing
dependencies efficiently.

Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when
working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts
between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main
reasons why you should use virtual environments:

  1. **Isolation** – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.

  2. **Reproducibility** – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.

  3. **Portability** – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.

* * *

  1. **Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)**

• Good for quick experimentation and testing.

• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update
and break compatibility over time.

  2. **Using requirements.txt**

• Best for **reproducibility** and **collaboration** since others can install
the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks
compatibility with another developer’s setup.

**Specifying Versions in requirements.txt**

• If you **don’t specify a version** , pip install -r requirements.txt will
install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected
breaking changes.

• If you **do specify a version (package==1.2.3)** , you ensure consistency
but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has
compatibility issues.

**Handling Version Conflicts**

• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version
constraint and reinstall.

• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:

• Using **greater than/less than constraints** : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows
updates but avoids major version changes).

• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.

**Best Practices Summary**

  * Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).
  * Use a **requirements.txt** file for reproducibility.
  * Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.
  * Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.

Kind regards

For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or
flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the
dependencies are interconnected with their versions.

Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation
is fine.

Coming to your second question,

The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version.
But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s
project it’s better to use requirements.txt.

The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version
is listed.

Thank you sir for clarifying.

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image shows a headshot of a man against a plain, light-
colored background. The lighting is relatively even, illuminating his face
well. **Subject:** * **Man:** The central figure is a man with short, neatly
styled dark hair. * **Glasses:** He is wearing rectangular-framed glasses. *
**Shirt:** He is wearing a dark purple/burgundy colored button-down shirt. *
**Facial Expression:** He appears to be smiling slightly. **Background:** *
The background appears to be a solid color, likely off-white or a very light
yellow/beige. It's a plain wall. **Overall:** The image seems to be a
straightforward headshot, likely taken for professional or personal use. ]

I wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely
address the error I mentioned in my question.
