[@23f1002630](/u/23f1002630) \- thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t
re-occur for anyone.

**What happened?** I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds,
but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length.
That’s what I fixed.

i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-02-12T12:52:01.867Z)

Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous

## Cleaning Data with OpenRefine

Kindly check the question and the answer. I found below cities for São Paulo.

However, it says my answer is incorrect.

> How many units of Bacon were sold in São Paulo on transactions with at least
> 151 units?
    
    
    city
    Sao Paolo
    Sao Paoulo
    Sao Paulo
    Sao Pualo
    Sau Paulo
    São Paulo
    
    

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the content in the
image: **Overall Image:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a portion of
a spreadsheet, likely from a program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
The spreadsheet contains data related to sales, organized by city and product.
**Columns and Headers:** * **Column A (City):** Contains names of cities. The
spellings vary slightly for "Sao Paulo" (Sao Paulo, Sao Pualo, Sao Paoulo, Sao
Paolo). This suggests potential data entry errors or variations in how the
city name is represented. * **Column B (Product):** Contains the product name,
which is consistently "Bacon" in the visible rows. * **Column C (Sales):**
Contains numerical values representing sales figures. The last visible cell in
this column contains the total: 2871. **Data Rows:** * There are five visible
rows of data, each containing a city name, the product "Bacon", and a sales
amount. * The sales amounts for Bacon in Sao Paulo (and its variations in
spelling) are: 488, 522, 650, 275, and 936. **Filtering:** * Each column
header (City, Product, Sales) has a filter icon (triangle inside a square)
suggesting that the data has filtering enabled. This allows users to sort and
filter the data based on specific criteria. **Formatting:** * The header row
is highlighted in orange, making it visually distinct. * The bottom-most total
is bolded. **Summary:** The image displays a small dataset of sales
information, showing sales of "Bacon" in "Sao Paulo" (with slightly different
spellings). The data is set up in a tabular format with filtering enabled. The
total sales are also shown. The inconsistencies in the spelling of Sao Paulo
are notable, suggesting potential data cleaning issues.]image318×183 5.46

Wrong / Confusing question Prof

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”

Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Content:** The image presents a "Peak Usage Analysis for Regional
Content" related to the website s-anand.net, which features region-specific
music content, particularly in Telugu. The analysis aims to determine the
number of successful GET requests for pages under the /telugu/ section during
peak hours on Saturdays in May 2024. **Key Elements and Information:** *
**Website Description:** *s-anand.net* is a personal website with a
significant Telugu section that hosts music files. * **Purpose:** The analysis
aims to understand user behavior, server load, and content engagement by
analyzing access logs from Apache web servers. * **Observed Pattern:** There
are unusual traffic patterns during weekend evenings. * **Specific Interest:**
How many successful requests are made to the Telugu section during peak hours
on Saturdays. * **Time Window:** From 13:00 until before 23:00 (hours). *
**Request Type:** Only GET requests. * **Success Criteria:** Requests that
return HTTP status codes between 200 and 299. * **Data Source:** GZipped
Apache log file for May 2024, containing 258,074 rows. * **Log File
Challenges:** * Logs are in the GMT-0500 timezone. * The file format is non-
standard (fields separated by spaces, with most fields quoted by double
quotes, except for the Time field). * Some lines have minor formatting issues
(41 rows). * **Task:** Determine the number of successful GET requests for
Telugu pages on Saturdays between May 13th and 23rd, 2024. * **Benefits of the
Analysis:** * Scale Resources: Ensure servers can handle peak load. * Content
Planning: Determine content popularity. * Marketing Insights: Tailor
promotional strategies. * **Log Entry Details:** Each row (log entry) contains
the following fields: * IP: Visitor's IP address. * Remote logname: Remote
logname. * Remote user: Remote user. * Time: Visit time (e.g.,
\\[01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]). * Request: Request made (e.g., GET /blog/
HTTP/1.1). * Status: HTTP status code (200-299 indicates success). * Size:
Response size in bytes. * Referer: Referer URL (e.g., https://s-anand.net/). *
User agent: Browser used. * Vhost: Virtual host (e.g., s-anand.net). * Server:
Server IP address. * **File Format:** Fields are separated by spaces and
quoted by double quotes (""). Quotes are escaped via \". * **Timezone:** All
data is in GMT-0500. * **Actions to be taken based on the determined number:**
* Optimize Infrastructure: Scale server resources * Strategize Content
Delivery: Identify popular content segments. * Improve Marketing Efforts:
Focus marketing initiatives. * **Final Question:** What is the number of
successful GET requests for pages under /telugu/ from 13:00 until before 23:00
on Sundays? **In summary, the image provides the context, requirements, and
data format details for an analysis task involving web server access logs to
determine peak usage patterns for a specific section of a website.**]grab-IIT-

maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the
answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this
question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here,
however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public

### NamanBeri (2025-02-15T17:19:27.591Z)

tried google sheets - it autoformatted my date data, also i realized later i
was applying the formula the wrong way.

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image's content:
**Overall Layout:** * The image presents a tabular data structure, resembling
a spreadsheet or a table from a business intelligence tool. * The table has
columns with headers and rows containing data entries. * The background color
alternates between a light blue and a white shade for each row, improving
readability. **Column Headers:** * **Country (Normalised):** Indicates the
country to which the data refers. * **DATE:** Represents the date associated
with the data in the row. * **Product:** Specifies the product being
referenced in the row. * **Sales:** Shows the sales figures for the product
and date. * **Cost:** Displays the cost associated with the product and date.
* Each column header has a filter icon which shows that the table is filtered.
**Data Content:** * **Country:** All rows have "United Arab Emirates" in this
column. * **Date:** Dates are in the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2023-02-07). The
dates range from 2022 to 2023. * **Product:** All rows contain the product
name "Kappa". * **Sales:** The Sales column shows numeric values. * **Cost:**
The Cost column has numeric values. **Specific Data Rows:** Here's a summary
of the first few rows: * Row 1: United Arab Emirates, 2023-02-07, Kappa,
1314.00 Sales, 4892.00 Cost * Row 2: United Arab Emirates, 2022-06-29, Kappa,
9370.00 Sales, 2214.00 Cost * Row 3: United Arab Emirates, 2023-02-04, Kappa,
5488.00 Sales, 2744.00 Cost * Row 4: United Arab Emirates, 2022-11-10, Kappa,

2029.00 Sales, 4891.00 Cost **Overall Impression:** The image likely
represents a data excerpt showing sales and cost information for the "Kappa"

filtered.]image987×176 14.4 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image's content:
**Overall Layout and Navigation** * The image shows a web interface, likely
from a Google service. The top URL indicates that the page relates to getting
an API key. * The interface has a left-hand navigation menu that includes
options like "Prompt," "Realtime," "Apps," "Model," "Live chat history,"
"Gallery," "Documentation," and a forum. * The main content area focuses on
API keys, specifically for the Gemini API. **Main Content: API Keys and Gemini
API** * The main heading of the page is "Get API key." * It then says "API
keys" with the description "Quickly test the Gemini API" * There is an "API
quickstart guide" link. * A `curl` command example is provided, showing how to
use the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate content with a text-based request:
* The command includes options for setting the content type to
`application/json` and using the `POST` method. * The data part of the command
contains a JSON payload with `"contents"` and `"parts"` that include the text
"Explain how AI works". * A "Create API key" button is prominently displayed.
**Error Message** * There is an error message displayed in a red-bordered box
at the bottom of the screen. * The error indicates that "Resource Manager
project creation is disabled." * It suggests contacting the administrator to
enable this setting. * The error contains a long technical message that
includes
`APPLICATION_ERROR:google.cloud.resourcemanager.v3/ProjectsV3.CreateProject`,
along with codes such as `AppErrorCode=9` and addresses. **API Key Listing** *
There are headings "Project number", "Project name", "API key", and "Created".
These are most likely headers for a table that would display existing API keys
once they are generated. **Footer Notice** * A footer notice is partially
visible that says "Remember to use API keys securely. Don't share or embed
them in public code. Use of Gemini API from a billing-..." **Overall
Impression** The image depicts a user interface for obtaining an API key for
the Google Gemini API. However, there is an error preventing the creation of a
new API key because project creation is disabled in Resource Manager.

The result should be a table with a single column called `post_id` , and the
relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.  
when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error :
**Error** : At root: Array length mismatch  
**Reason** : below query checking only 1st comment (`$[0]` refers to the first
comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.  
But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different
types of error.

    
    
    WITH filtered_posts AS (
      SELECT post_id
      FROM social_media
      WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
        AND EXISTS (
          SELECT 1
          FROM social_media AS sm
          WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
            AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
        )
    )
    SELECT post_id
    FROM filtered_posts
    ORDER BY post_id ASC;
    

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.  
May be my query is wrong or may be not.

Thankyou

[@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)

Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be
difficult to debug.

Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.  
In this case its an ordered `post_id`

So thats where you begin:

    
    
    SELECT post_id
    FROM (
    ...
    )
    ORDER BY post_id
    

Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.

Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.  
You will still need the `post_id` for the _outermost layer_ so you have to
continue extracting it from the _inner layers_ of the nested query.

    
    
    ...
    ...
    FROM (
       SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
       FROM social_media
       WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
          AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
    )
    ...
    ...
    

Then the final layer of the nest

    
    
    ...
    ...
    (
    
    ) as max_stars
    ...
    ...
    

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner
most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful
capability)

But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory
language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.

Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work
backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the
outer layer to be functional.

Kind regards

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-02-20T03:31:24.326Z)

Its been done. You will get a more detailed error now. And we have relaxed the
number of errors allowed (it actually did have a tolerance limit but it was
fairly tight)

### Daksh Agarwal (2025-02-20T05:33:29.345Z)

sir even after applying this logic im getting error at root: array length
mismatch


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-02-20T05:41:41.335Z)

[@daksh76](/u/daksh76) thats because your innermost logic layer must not
return a long list of results.

If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one
of the columns is a whole row of results right?

Thats why you are getting the error.

Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.

Kind regards

### LAKSHAY (2025-02-20T06:00:14.975Z)

Thank you for your response [@carlton](/u/carlton). You are absolutely
right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler
approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered
multiple errors, including:

  1. **`json_extract`** : _“Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”_
  2. **`json_each`** : _“Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”_
  3. **`json_extract_path_text`** : _“Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”_

Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to
achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected
output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the
console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am
still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.  
I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the
exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for
**Q8**.

Thankyou

This might help :wink:

[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall
Impression:** The image appears to be a close-up shot against a very dark,
likely black background. The primary focus is on two glowing yellow shapes.
**Detailed Description:** * **Shapes:** There are two distinctly separate,
bright yellow shapes. One is larger and more circular, while the other is
smaller and more elongated or oval-shaped. * **Color & Lighting:** The yellow
color is vivid and radiant, suggesting that these shapes are either emitting
light or reflecting it very strongly. The lighting effect around the shapes
seems soft or blurred. * **Background:** The background is dark and void,
giving strong contrast to the glowing yellow shapes. This darkness makes the
yellow shapes stand out. * **Size & Proximity:** The shapes are close to each
other. There is space between them, but they're positioned near each other on
what appears to be a horizontal plane. **Possible Interpretations:** Given
that the image is simple and composed of basic shapes, possible
interpretations include: * **Abstract Art:** It could be an abstract artwork
focusing on color contrast and shape. * **Electronic Components:** The shapes
could be illuminated electronic components or lights on some form of
technology device. * **Celestial Bodies:** With a little imagination, the
image could be interpreted as representing a planet and its moon or distant
stars in the night sky. * **Indicator lights:** The shapes could be indicative
lights or bulbs next to each other on some kind of machine or appliance. **In
short:** The image prominently features two bright yellow shapes on a black
backdrop, one larger and rounder, and the other smaller and elongated. The
shapes appear luminous. The simple composition opens the image to various
interpretations.]
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/query_syntax/unnest.html)

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: The image
features a completely black background with a single yellow graphic element
positioned near the center. The element consists of a large, solid yellow
circle with a smaller, rounded yellow rectangle attached to its right side.
This could be interpreted as a stylized representation of a button, a toggle
switch, or a stylized depiction of two combined elements. The composition is
minimalist, focusing entirely on this central graphic against the stark black
backdrop. There are no other visible elements or text present.]

### [Unnesting](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/query_syntax/unnest.html)

Examples Unnest a list, generating 3 rows (1, 2, 3): SELECT unnest([1, 2, 3]);
Unnesting a struct, generating two columns (a, b): SELECT unnest({'a': 42,

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image is a headshot portrait of a man. He is well-lit
against a plain, light-colored background. He is wearing professional attire,
suggesting a business or formal context. **Specific Features:** * **Person:**
The subject is a man with short, dark hair and a clean-shaven face. He has a
warm, friendly expression. * **Clothing:** He is wearing a white collared
shirt and a dark (possibly black) blazer or suit jacket. A pocket square is
subtly visible on the left side of the jacket. * **Background:** The
background is a plain, solid, light color (likely white or off-white). It is
featureless and does not distract from the subject. * **Lighting:** The
lighting appears to be soft and diffused, creating minimal harsh shadows on
the face. It suggests a controlled lighting environment, possibly a studio
setting. * **Composition:** The subject is centered in the frame, with his
head and shoulders filling most of the space. * **Text:** There is no visible
text in the image. **Overall Context:** The image has the characteristics of a
professional headshot. It could be used on a business website, social media
profile, or other professional context.] lakshaygarg654:

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content, focusing on
details relevant to answering questions: **Overall Content:** The image
presents a data cleaning and analysis task for a company named RetailWise Inc.
They have messy sales data in an Excel sheet and need to calculate the total
margin for specific transactions based on certain criteria. The image outlines
the task, defines the margin formula, details the data cleaning challenges,
and provides a link to download the Excel file. It concludes with a specific
question about the total margin. **Key Text and Information:** * **Title:**
"Improving Sales Data Accuracy for RetailWise Inc." * **Problem Description:**
RetailWise has sales data with OCR inconsistencies and legacy formatting
issues, making the Excel sheet unclean. * **Messy Data Columns:** * Customer
Name (leading/trailing spaces) * Country (inconsistent representations e.g.,
"USA", "US", "UK", "Fra" for France, "Bra" for Brazil, "Ind" for India.) *
Date (mixed formats, "MM-DD-YYYY", "YYYY/MM/DD") * Product (product name
followed by a slash and a random code, e.g., "Theta/5x01vd". Only the product
name before the slash is relevant.) * Sales and Cost (extra spaces, currency
string "USD", missing cost treated as 50% of sales) * TransactionID

before the slash). * **Country Filter:** Country "US" (after standardizing
country names). * **Margin Formula:** Total Margin= (Total Sales - Total Cost)
/ (Total Sales) * **Data Cleaning Challenges:** 1\. Trim and Normalize Strings
(Customer Name, Country) 2\. Standardize Date Formats 3\. Extract Product Name
(before slash) 4\. Clean and Convert Sales and Cost (remove "USD", convert to

sold in **the US** (which may be spelled in different ways).

However, when I filter in Excel for **US** and **Theta** , there are no

For Q8, I wrote the following query,

    
    
    SELECT smo.post_id
    FROM social_media as smo
    WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
    AND EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM LATERAL (
           SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
           FROM social_media as sm
           WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
           ) AS c(value)
        WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
    order by smo.post_id;
    

What it does is for each post_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the
presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this
post_id. Finally returns all the post_id’s in ascending order.

But it’s giving me an `Array length mismatch` error. I’m stuck here. Any hints
would be helpful. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

**QUESTION 9**

I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain
time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences
from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the
error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual
audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know
what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the
exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5
seconds.

Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda
followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of
determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of
friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage
beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy,
and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best
left undisturbed.

In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice
emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some
secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”

The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of
Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden
alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.

Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that
manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation
tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.

From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with
names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary,
strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal
hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored
evidence of their manipulations.

### Andrew David (2025-02-24T05:44:46.473Z)

is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the
deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for
learning sake. I had exams and would like do week 4,week 5 before week 6 and
doing the assignment is a huge part in learning, any on the just doing the
assignments or answers for the assignments? I understand that each set of
students get different questions. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)
