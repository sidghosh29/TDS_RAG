Hello,

I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not
see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and
attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

[@Muthupalaniappan](/u/muthupalaniappan)

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal
question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure
you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1
on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for
grading.

Kind regards

### Kundan Kumar (2025-01-27T05:29:27.718Z)

Dear Sir,  
I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA
1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our
actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

Hello,  
I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved
it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a
lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9, so I kindly request you to
consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.

### Khushi Shah (2025-01-27T09:52:32.240Z)

Respected Sir,  
I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal  
According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers
submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation
regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?  
Thanks


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-01-27T10:30:47.309Z)

[@23f2005471](/u/23f2005471)

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga
page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you
were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Kind regards

Dear [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link)
that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the
portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??

I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.

I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact
my grade particularly as of this course.  
I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image
attached below I erred up with this submission  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content,
focusing on text and relevant features: **Overall Content:** The image is a
screenshot of an online quiz or assignment question. It shows a question
related to a graded assignment, followed by multiple-choice options ("Yes" or
"No"), and feedback on the answer. **Text Elements and Key Features:** *
**Question Text:** "1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this
link and have attempted it." This implies that the question is about whether
the user has accessed and tried to complete a specific graded assignment. *
**Link:** The phrase "this link" is likely a hyperlink that directs to the
assignment. The text itself is underlined and has a different color which
suggests a link. * **Multiple Choice Options:** * "Yes" - This is one of the
possible answers. * "No" - The alternative answer. * **Feedback:** * "No, the
answer is incorrect." - This indicates that the chosen answer was wrong. The
text is in red, emphasizing the error. * "Score: 0" - Displays a score of 0,
likely reflecting that the question was answered incorrectly. * **Accepted
Answers:** * "Accepted Answers:" - Specifies the correct answer. * "Yes" -
Indicates that the correct answer for the question is "Yes". **In summary, the
image shows a question that the user answered incorrectly. The question asks
if they have seen and attempted a graded assignment, and the correct answer is
"Yes".**]image747×473 15 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

Good evening, I have submitted my GA1 in the ex website  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content,
focusing on text and relevant features: **Overall Impression:** The image
appears to be a screenshot of a quiz or assignment interface on a learning
platform. The interface has a dark theme, and we can see information about the
assignment's deadline, instructions, user account details, and recent saves.
**Key Textual Elements:** * **Deadline:** "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59
pm IST" - This tells us the assignment deadline has passed. *
**Instructions/Guidelines:** A numbered list outlines rules and tips for the
assignment: * "Browser may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off
security restrictions or try a different browser." * "Use anything. You can
use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any
libraries or frameworks you want." * "It's hackable. It's possible to get the
answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed." *
**Advice/Considerations:** "Should you take TDS this term?" followed by: * "If
this assignment takes you under 2 hours to complete, you will likely do OK in
TDS." * "If you score above 8 / 10, you might get an S or A grade, with effort
and luck." * **Discussion Link:** "Have questions? Join the discussion on
Discourse" - There is a link to a discussion forum. * **User Information:**
"You are logged in as 2311002223@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." - This indicates the
user's login ID. * **Logout:** Button to log out * **Recent Saves:** A list of
recent saves for the assignment, including the date, time, and score. For
example, "Reload from 1/26/2025, 11:59:45 PM. Score: 9.5" **Visual Features:**
* **Color Scheme:** The primary colors are shades of dark gray or black, with
teal accents for interactive elements like links and buttons. The header at
the top is a bright reddish-pink. * **Layout:** The information is structured
in sections with clear headings. * **Interactive Elements:** Links ("Join the
discussion on Discourse," "Logout", and "Reload") are visually highlighted.
**In summary, the image depicts a screen capture from an online quiz or
assignment platform. It highlights the completed nature of the assignment
(past deadline), the user's score, and provides a few intriguing instructions

I have done my GA1 and scored 10/10 still it’s showing 0 on my dashboard.  

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Impression:** The image is a screenshot of a webpage, likely an
online coding assessment or training platform. The screen displays a database
query and information about its correctness. **Textual Elements:** * **URL:**
The URL `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1` appears at the top,
indicating a specific exam or exercise. * **Date and Time:** "Due Sun, 26 Jan,
2025, 11:59 pm IST" specifies a deadline. * **Score:** "Score: 10/10" means
that the user achieved a perfect score on this question. * **Database Query
(SQL):** * `FROM tickets` - This specifies the table from which to retrieve
data. * `WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'gold';` - This is the core logic of the
query: * `TRIM(type)` removes leading and trailing spaces from the "type"
column. * `LOWER(...)` converts the trimmed "type" to lowercase. * `= 'gold'`
compares the result to the string "gold" (lowercase). * **Correct Message:**
"Correct" appears, indicating that the query is accepted. * **Instruction:**
"Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings
like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units." This explains
the purpose of the query. * **Submission Status:** * "Submitted" * "If you
submit again, it will overwrite your previous submission and score." * "Save
regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated." **Other Visual
Elements:** * **Buttons:** "Check" and "Save" buttons are visible near the
top, implying interactive functionality. * **Color Scheme:** The interface
appears to use a dark theme with green accents, indicating positive feedback.
**In summary:** The image captures a student's successful submission of a SQL
query designed to retrieve rows from a "tickets" table where the "type"
column, after being cleaned up and converted to lowercase, matches the value
"gold". The task instructions emphasize flexibility in matching "gold"
regardless of casing or whitespace. The perfect score and "Correct" message
confirm the successful completion of the task. ]GA11519×799 75.2
