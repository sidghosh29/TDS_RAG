Dear all,

I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in
Data Science * course: [**LLM Classroom Assignment
Evaluator**](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom).
This is the basic prototype.

This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for
Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for
educators.

A heartfelt thanks to **[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)** , our course instructor, and
TAs **[@Carlton](/u/carlton)** and **[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)** , whose guidance
on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project
possible.

I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

  * Expand functionality and evaluation models.
  * Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
  * Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom)
is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating
with you all!

Update: here is a video explaining the process -

Best regards,

Hi Avinash,

Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the
course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine
it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this
approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.

Kind regards

Thanks [@carlton](/u/carlton) [Image description: Here's a detailed
description of the image: **Content:** The image features a digital emoji. *
**Emoji:** It is a yellow, circular face with a soft, warm expression. *
**Facial Features:** It has simple, curved, closed eyes shaped like
semicircles. A gentle, closed smile extends across the lower half of the face.
Lightly blushed, rosy pink cheeks give it a sweet, cheerful appearance. *
**Color and Style:** The yellow color has a gradient effect, suggesting a
three-dimensional appearance. The pixelated edges suggest it may be a digital
image or a screenshot. * **Background:** The emoji is set against a plain
black background.] I would definitely refine it.
