Hello Sir,

I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs
scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or
if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be
able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.

Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings?
Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and
how the mock links will be shared.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Tag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time…

It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time
during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will
freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it
later.

ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.

Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.  
The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.  
_The problem is the lack of time._

So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins
and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you
stand.

Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to
do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.

Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have
the same types of questions. Not with ROE.

The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.  
But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.

Kind regards

hi [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
how are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i
join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these
doubts. thanks in advance!

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-02-25T10:58:33.712Z)

You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.  
I will also add the same in the student seek portal.  
Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored
either!  
The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.

Kind regards

3 questions:-

  * will the questions and dataset be available after time limit?
  * will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?
  * will the live solving video lecture be recorded?

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image based on the
provided visual data: **Content:** The image shows a cropped portion of a
character, specifically focusing on the upper part of their head and face. *
**Character:** The character appears to be an anime/manga style depiction of
Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece. This is evident from the iconic straw hat he
is wearing. * **Straw Hat:** The most prominent feature is the straw hat,
which is colored a bright yellow/gold. It has a red band around the base. A
small, slightly frayed detail (possibly a patch or decoration) is visible on
the hat. * **Face:** We can see part of Luffy's face below the hat. It
includes dark hair, eyes with dark pupils, and a glimpse of his mouth, which
appears to be in a smiling expression. * **Background:** The background is a
solid, light orange/peach color. **In summary:** The image prominently
features the straw hat of Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece, along with a cropped
view of his face, all set against a plain orange background.] 23f1002382:

They will be available after the live session has finished.

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Content:**
The image appears to be a cropped portion of an illustration or digital
graphic. The primary focus is on a character, specifically their head and part
of their shoulders/upper body. **Character Features:** * **Hat:** The
character wears a distinctive straw hat with a reddish-brown band. This type
of hat is often associated with the character Monkey D. Luffy from the
anime/manga series "One Piece." * **Hair:** Dark or black hair is visible
under the hat. * **Expression:** The character seems to have a determined or
serious facial expression. **Background:** * The background is a solid, light-
orange color. **Overall Impression:** The image strongly suggests a stylized
or cartoonish depiction, likely from an anime or manga. The style and the hat,
in particular, are strong indicators of the character Monkey D. Luffy from
"One Piece."] 23f1002382:

> will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?

We will provide an answer script for Mock ROE1

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Content:** *
**Character:** The image features a cartoonish rendition of Monkey D. Luffy,
the protagonist from the anime/manga series "One Piece." We only see the upper
part of his head and hat. * **Hat:** He's wearing his iconic straw hat (or
'mugiwara'), which is yellowish-brown with a red band around the base. *
**Expression:** He has a mischievous or playful expression. His eyes are
visible, and there's a hint of a grin. * **Background:** The background is a
solid, light orange or peach color. **Overall impression:** The image seems to
be a simplified or stylized depiction of Luffy, possibly used as an avatar or
profile picture. The bright color palette and cartoonish style give it a
cheerful and lighthearted feel.] 23f1002382:

> will the live solving video lecture be recorded?

Yes our live sessions will be recorded.

### B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA (2025-02-25T13:36:56.128Z)

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given
time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for
mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you
have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes.

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image is a close-up headshot of a man. It appears to be a
medium-quality photograph, possibly taken indoors with artificial lighting.
**Person Description:** * **Gender:** Male * **Age:** Appears to be in his
late 20s to mid-30s. * **Ethnicity:** The person appears to be of South Asian
descent. * **Hair:** Short, dark hair, neatly styled. * **Facial Features:**
He has a slightly tanned complexion, a moderate nose, and a warm smile. He is
wearing glasses with dark frames. * **Attire:** He is wearing a dark purple or
maroon button-down shirt. **Background:** * The background is a solid, pale
yellow color. It is indistinct and does not provide much context about the
location. **Overall Analysis:** This appears to be a casual portrait of a man,
likely taken for professional or personal use. There are no obvious signs of
editing or manipulation. The person seems approachable and friendly. ]
