Same issue with me sir.  
This is how my dashboard looks like. It shows the same for week 2 as well.

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: The image
appears to be a screenshot of an online learning platform, likely a course
management system, from IIT Madras. The screen is divided into sections:
**Left Sidebar:** * Shows a navigation menu with icons and text. * Options
include "Modules" and "Grades", with "Grades" currently selected and
highlighted in a darker shade. * There is a section called "Module 1:
Development Tools," which is expanded to show "Graded Assignment 1" beneath
it, marked as an "Assignment". * Below, there's another section, "Module 2:
Deployment Tools," which is collapsed. **Main Content Area:** * The title of
the page is "Graded Assignment 1." * The "Due date for this assignment" is
listed as "2025-01-26, 23:59 IST." * A message indicates that submissions can
be made multiple times before the due date, but the final submission will be
considered. * A section provides troubleshooting advice for difficulty
accessing the graded assignment. The listed possible causes are: * Ad blockers
needing to be disabled/removed. * Cookies being required for authentication,
advising to disable cookie blocking/tracker blocking. * Javascript being
required for the site to work. * Chrome Browser being the recommended
software. * Browser extensions interfering with the site. * Overly aggressive
anti-virus software. * There is a warning to use the Student ID (e.g.,
22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) for the graded assignment evaluation. * A
question asks, "I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and
have attempted it." * Two radio buttons are available for response: "Yes" and
"No." **Top Banner:** * The IIT Madras logo is in the upper left corner. *
Text "IIT Madras" is displayed beside the logo. * The text "Jan 2025- TDS" is
to the right of that. In summary, the image shows a page for "Graded
Assignment 1" within an online course, with details about the due date,
submission guidelines, troubleshooting tips, and a question about accessing
and attempting the assignment. ]dashboard_tds_jahnaviHunsigida936×561 93.3

Likewise the GAs also are available through the links in the seek portal as
well as on the course domain shared above.

The course introduction has very important information. Many students who
faced problems in Tools for Data Science in previous terms usually never read
the intro. Please be diligent to read _everything carefully._

Don’t gloss over these bits (they are expandable if you click on them) for eg…

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content: The
image presents a list of four bullet points against a dark gray background.
Each bullet point begins with a triangular arrow-shaped bullet symbol. The
text for each point is written in white, clear sans-serif font. Here's a
breakdown of each bullet point: 1\. **This course exposes you to real-life
tools:** This statement suggests that the course being referred to provides
practical experience with tools used in real-world scenarios. 2\. **This
course is quite hard:** This indicates the level of difficulty associated with
the course. 3\. **Programming skills are a pre-requisite:** This implies that
prior knowledge and competence in programming are necessary for successful
participation in the course. 4\. **We encourage learning by sharing:** This
highlights a collaborative learning environment within the course where
students are encouraged to share knowledge and ideas. ]Screenshot 2025-01-13

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content:
**Overall Layout:** The image appears to be a screenshot of a course
description or information page, possibly from an online learning platform.
The background is a dark grey or blue-grey color. The text is predominantly
white, with some highlighted elements. **Text Elements:** * **Course
Title/Introduction:** * "This course exposes you to real-life tools" * "This
course is quite hard" (with a downward arrow, indicating it might be an
expandable section) * **Student Feedback:** * "Here's students' feedback:"
followed by a bulleted list of comments: * "It used to be an easy course until
2024. ###" * "Now it's hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if
possible. ###" * "Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit
courses. ###" * "LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #" * "The ROE is hard. #" *
**Prerequisites/Skills:** * "You need a good understanding of Python,
JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts." * **Call to
Action/Advice:** * "Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you're ready for this
course. Please drop this course in a later term if you score low. It'll be too
tough for you now." * **Additional Information (Collapsible):** * "Programming
skills are a pre-requisite" (with a right-pointing arrow, suggesting it can be
expanded) * "We encourage learning by sharing" (with a right-pointing arrow,
suggesting it can be expanded) **Visual Features:** * **Arrows:** The presence
of downward and right-pointing arrows suggests interactive elements where
sections of the content can be expanded or collapsed. * **Bullet Points:**
Used to format the student feedback for readability. * **Highlighted Text:**
The phrase "Take Graded assignment 1" is bolded and possibly has a different
color, drawing the viewer's attention. * **"###" and "#" Symbols:** These
likely represent placeholders or omitted information (possibly names, or
specific details redacted from student comments). **Inferences &
Interpretations:** * The course appears to have become more challenging
recently. * Strong foundational knowledge of programming and data science is
important. * Students are advised to self-assess their readiness before
committing to the course. * The course involves LLMs (likely large language
models) in grading, adding a layer of unpredictability. ]Screenshot 2025-01-13

### MANAN SHAH (2025-01-25T11:46:39.675Z)

I’m confused where exactly is the TDS course?  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content,

quiz/assignment interface. It has a sidebar on the left for navigation and a
larger content area on the right. **Left Sidebar:** * **Modules:** It shows a
hierarchical list of modules. * Course Introduction * Module 1: Development
Tools * Graded Assignment 1 (Highlighted, indicating the current view) *
Module 2: Deployment Tools * Module 3: Large Language Models * Project 1 *
Learning Feedback **Main Content Area (Graded Assignment 1):** * **Title:**
"Graded Assignment 1" * **Due Date:**"Due date for this assignment:
2025-01-26, 23:59 IST." * **Submission Info:** "You may submit any number of
times before the due date. The final submission will be considered for
grading." * **Troubleshooting Section:** A list of potential reasons for
difficulty accessing the assignment: 1\. "Ad blockers need to be
disabled/removed." 2\. "The site requires cookies for authentication. So any
cookie blocking/tracker blocking extensions or software may prevent access."
3\. "Javascript is required for the site to work correctly." 4\. "Chrome
Browser is the recommended software to access the contents." 5\. "Disable any
browser extensions that may be interfere with the site from working
correctly." 6\. "Overly aggressive anti-virus software may also cause similar
access problems." * **Important Note:** "You MUST use your Student Id (eg.
223fxxxxx@iits.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment, otherwise your
score will not be considered for evaluation." * **Question:**"1) I have seen
the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it." *
**Answer Options:** * Yes * No * **Button:** "Submit Answers" **Other
Details** * There is a link after the question "1) I have seen the Graded
Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it." **In Summary:**
The image shows an online graded assignment within a learning platform. It
includes the due date, submission instructions, potential access
troubleshooting tips, a critical note about using the correct student ID, a
confirmation question about accessing and attempting the assignment, and a
"Submit Answers" button. ]image1920×1073 124 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

Where are the weekly videos?  
Where and what is the assignment?  
I’m confused.

the side. He is wearing glasses with thick, dark frames. He has a light
complexion. * **Clothing:** He's wearing a button-down shirt. The shirt is a
dark purple color. * **Facial Features:** The man has a slight smile. *
**Background:** The background is plain and appears to be a light beige or
