[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image's content:
**Overall Layout** The image appears to be a screenshot of a source control
history display, likely from a code editor or a Git client. It shows a series
of commits or changesets in a project. **Key Elements** 1\. **Header:** *
"SOURCE CONTROL GR..." - Indicates the window's purpose. * Icons: Several
icons related to source control functionalities (e.g., refresh, settings). 2\.
**Commit History:** * A vertical line with circles represents the branch's
history. The line is made up of different colors. * Each entry on the line
represents a commit. 3\. **Commit Messages:** Each commit is described with a
short message: * "Merge pull request #2 from de..." (The branch seems to be
"main" in the upper-right, which may be the source.) * "Added chardet code to
get file encoding deb..." * "Merge pull request #3 from 23f2000573/II..." *
"Rename README.txt.txt to README_LLM.tx..." * "Ilm code week-3 23f2000573" *
"Merge branch 'main' of https://github.co..." * "Merge pull request #1 from
painful-bug/..." * "Aishik Bandyopadhyay signing off painful-b..." * "Add link
to base64guru website. ritwiktrivedi" * "Added one Nominatim API sample and
ins..." * "Added file with mock1 data extraction. Adde..." * "Added an
extractions notebook with correct ..." **Observations & Potential Inferences**
* **Git-based Project:** The "pull request" and "merge branch" messages
suggest the project is using Git for version control. * **Branching and
Merging:** The lines connecting the commits indicate branching and merging
operations within the project's history. * **File Modifications:** Some
messages describe file changes (e.g., renaming, adding files). * **Feature
Development:** Several commits point to new features or improvements: "chardet
code," "Nominatim API sample," "extractions notebook." * **Branch Name:** The
"main" branch is explicitly labeled. * **Merge Commit Detail:** The merge
commits denote which branch merged into the "main" branch. **In summary, the
image displays a visual representation of a project's Git commit history,
highlighting branch merges, file modifications, and the development process
over time.**]image401×374 21 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

Failure is part of life. My laptop hanged and despite having all the needed
resources I panicked and the exam went the way it went. I take this as a
lesson. This resource will be refined further. I thank everyone involved. I am
glad that many benefitted and were actually able to score well.
