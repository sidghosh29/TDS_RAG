[Image description: Here's a description of the image, focusing on the
details: **Overall Impression:** The image appears to be a snapshot of a
person indoors, possibly in a casual setting like a cafe or waiting area. The
quality of the image is a bit low-resolution, so some details are less clear.
**Person:** * The primary subject is a person who appears to be male. * He is
smiling and looking slightly off-camera. * He is wearing a striped shirt
(possibly blue and white), and blue jeans. * The person has dark hair.
**Background:** * There are other objects in the background that include what
appears to be furniture and items on shelves. There are also items on display
that include what may be glasses or jewelry. **Overall:** The photo gives a
sense of a casual, everyday moment captured indoors, likely with the person
posing for the shot. ] [GA2 - Deployment Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan

Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is
not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have
submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it
cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some
time.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside
your seek portal.

**The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.** Just ignore anything
inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards
exists.

As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The
final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not
match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us
regarding your marks.

Kind regards

Please refer to this post.

[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image is a medium close-up shot of a person with dark hair
and glasses. The background is a solid, light color, possibly a warm off-white
or light yellow. **Subject Description:** * **Person:** The person appears to
be male. He has short, dark hair that is neatly styled. He is wearing
rectangular-framed glasses. The person is also wearing a purple button-down
shirt, with the top button undone. He is looking towards the camera with a
slight smile. His skin tone appears to be warm. * **Facial Features:** He has
dark eyes and a small, well-defined nose. His lips are thin and slightly
pursed, contributing to the subtle smile. **Background:** * The background is
plain and monochromatic, a light cream or yellow hue. This simplicity
emphasizes the subject and minimizes distractions. **Overall Style & Tone:** *
The image has a professional or friendly vibe. The simple background and clear
focus suggest it could be a profile photo, a corporate headshot, or a casual
portrait. If you have specific questions about the image, please ask! ] [Tds:

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image content,
focusing on text, objects, and relevant features: **General Overview:** The
image shows a web page interface for a graded assignment. It appears to be a
quiz or exam environment. The page includes information about the assignment
deadline, score, and some instructions/notes for the user. **Key Textual
Elements:** * **Title Bar:** The title bar indicates the following: "Graded
Assignment 3 : IITM Co," "TDS 2025 Jan GA3-Large Land," and "Inbox (1,273) -
23f3004066..." suggesting this is a graded assignment, possibly related to
"TDS 2025 Jan GA3," and is being viewed within a browser with email open. *
**Assignment Details:** * "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" - This
specifies the due date/time of the assignment. * "Score: 0" - Indicates the
user's current score is zero. * **Instructions/Notes (Rules):** * "5. Browser
may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or
try a different browser." * "6. Use anything. You can use any resources you
want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or
frameworks you want." * "7. It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to
some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed." * "Note:
You'll run multiple servers in this exam. All of them must be running
simultaneously while checking or saving answers." * **Help Section:** * "Have
questions? Join the discussion on Discourse" - provides a link to a discussion
forum for asking questions. * **User Information:** * "You are logged in as
23f3004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" - Shows the user's login email address. *
"Logout" - provides a logout option. * **Recent Saves:** * "Recent saves" - A
section with information about recent saves, including the date, time, and
score. * "Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:41 PM. Score: 8" * "Reload from 2/1/2025,
4:06:37 PM. Score: 8" * "Reload from 2/1/2025, 4:06:32 PM. Score: 8" * **Other
text:** * "Questions" - indicates that question section comes after.
**Interactive Elements:** * "Check all" button * "Save" button * "Reload"
buttons next to each saved attempt. **Overall Impression:** The image depicts
an online exam or quiz environment with relaxed rules, allowing access to
external resources and even "hacking" to find answers. The student's initial
score is zero. The interface also shows the history of save attempts,
indicating prior progress on the assignment, with a reload option. ]Screenshot

Dear Bhavanagv,

The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek
portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated
externally from the seek portal.

Kind regards

### Reva Lakshmy Paul (2025-02-03T12:50:07.690Z)

I had submitted the assignment still it’s shwoing that my score is 0 and that
i have not submitted the assignment.

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: The image
shows a screen displaying "Recent saves" from a game or application. The
background is dark, with a lighter green rectangular area containing the text.
Here's a breakdown of the elements: * **Title:** The title "Recent saves"
appears at the top in a light green font. * **Save Entries:** Below the title,
there are three entries for recent saves. Each entry includes: * A button
labeled "Reload" enclosed in a blue rectangle. * The text "from 2/2/2025,
[time] PM. Score: 4". The times for each save are 9:04:58 PM, 9:04:53 PM, and
9:04:51 PM, respectively. * The scores are all listed as 4. * **Color
Scheme:** The dominant colors are dark blues/grays for the background and the
rectangles around "Reload", with light green for the text. * **Formatting:**
The entries are stacked vertically, with each line providing details about the
save time and score. There's a red dot to the side of the reload button on the
top save.]image547×258 12.3 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and GA3 for TDS, even after
submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed
assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and
was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.

### SATISH KUMAR (2025-05-31T09:10:55.326Z)

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final
score is showing as **4.25** , but while attempting the assignment earlier, I
had scored **7.25** shown after submission.

Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to
ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.


---
### Carlton D'Silva (2025-05-31T09:14:12.326Z)

Hi Satish,

Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before
submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load
previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service
is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you
will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any
live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last
saved score is correct.

Kind regards
