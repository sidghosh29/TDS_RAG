have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any
manner.

Regards,  
Ajit

### Carlton D'Silva (2025-03-27T07:49:58.069Z)

No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon
announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs
we get bitten by.

Kind regards

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image is a headshot of a man with a neutral expression. The
background is a plain, light yellow or beige color, suggesting an indoor
setting with neutral lighting. **Detailed Description:** * **Subject:** The
primary subject is a man with short, dark hair that is neatly styled. *
**Facial Features:** He has a moderate complexion and a slight smile. He is
wearing black-rimmed glasses. His eyebrows are dark and well-defined. *
**Clothing:** The man is wearing a dark purple or reddish-purple collared
shirt. The top button of the shirt is undone. * **Background:** The background
is a solid, light color that provides contrast to the man's hair and shirt.
There are no visible patterns or objects in the background. * **Lighting:**
The lighting appears to be soft and even, casting minimal shadows. **Possible
Interpretations/Insights:** * The image is likely a professional headshot. The
plain background, neutral expression, and neat appearance suggest it could be
used for business, social media, or other professional purposes. If you have
specific questions about the image, please ask! I will do my best to analyze
the image further to answer your questions.] carlton:

You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.  
i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25

Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Overall
Impression:** The image is a digital artwork depicting a figure silhouetted
against a dramatic and surreal landscape. The color palette is dominated by
cool blues and warm oranges, creating a striking contrast. The overall mood is
contemplative and mystical. **Key Features:** * **Figure:** In the foreground,
there's a silhouetted figure, likely human, appearing to be seated in a
meditative posture. The figure is positioned centrally, drawing the viewer's
attention. * **Sky:** A large, moon-like shape dominates the background. It
seems to be a celestial body with a complex, swirling texture, reminiscent of
nebulae or celestial gas clouds. * **Landscape:** The landscape appears to be
rocky and perhaps mountainous. The warm orange colors suggest a fire or a
light source illuminating the rocks from below. * **Color Palette:** The color
scheme is key. The blue sky contrasts sharply with the fiery orange below,
creating a sense of tension and balance. * **Absence of Text:** There is no
apparent text within the image. ] 23f2004912:

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: The image
depicts a dramatic and somewhat humorous scene featuring a person being
threatened by a large, monstrous creature resembling Godzilla. The main
components are: * **Godzilla-like Monster:** This large, grey-scaled creature
with prominent spikes and sharp teeth is positioned behind and slightly above
the person. Its mouth is open wide, suggesting it is about to attack or
consume the individual. * **Person:** A bearded man wearing sunglasses and a
dark suit is shown screaming in terror. The man appears to be injured or
bloodied, adding to the sense of imminent danger. * **Text Overlay:** In the
upper left of the image, the text "Tools in Data Science" is written. *
**Background:** The background is a murky, grey sky or landscape, which
enhances the dramatic and ominous mood. Overall, the image is a metaphorical
representation of the intimidating or overwhelming nature of the "Tools in
Data Science", using the imagery of a monstrous creature threatening a
person.]tools in datascience1024×939 134 KB](https://europe1.discourse-
