### Lovepreet Singh (2025-03-02T11:45:12.668Z)

The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite
confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options
are correct in each case. I’m unsure whether to choose one of the correct
options or if the question is actually asking for the incorrect one. Could
someone please clarify?

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
I have similar concern  
For Q1, I used the following code:

    
    
    print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
    kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
    for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
        pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
        print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')
    

And got the following output:

    
    
    Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
    	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
    	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
    	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04
    

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.  

[[Image could not be described]image281×219 9.1 KB](https://europe1.discourse-

"image")

Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:

    
    
    print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
    pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
    for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
        pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
        print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')
    

and got the following answers:

    
    
    Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
    	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
    	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
    	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08
    

The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and
Mileage).

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Dear TDS Team,

There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent
attention:

  1. Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.
  2. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.
  3. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.

The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved.
Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon
as possible.

Thank you for your support.

### Pradeep Mondal (2025-03-12T13:30:00.912Z)

Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.

For instance:

> forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using
> historical data.

but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are
specified?

### Khushi Shah (2025-03-15T05:54:10.148Z)

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
My question 7 for GA6 is :  
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need
to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency
Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most
efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The
four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant
Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village :
(42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central
Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package,
calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs
Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance  
Whose options provided are :  
10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873
meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)

I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit
shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)  
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination
from central command post)

My question 9 for GA6 is :  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  

[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image: **Content
Overview:** The image is a screenshot of a Python code snippet along with its
corresponding output. The code calculates the distances between several
communities (OakParkTown, EastSpringsSettlement, EastFieldsJunction,
RedPointTown) and a central command post using the haversine formula. It then
sorts the communities based on their distances and prints the optimal
evacuation sequence. **Code Analysis:** * **Imports:** `from haversine import
haversine`: Imports the haversine function from the haversine library. This
function calculates the distance between two points on a sphere given their
latitudes and longitudes. * **Coordinate Definition:** Defines coordinates
(latitude, longitude) for each community and the central command post. These
are represented as tuples. * **Distance Calculation:** A dictionary called
`distances` is created. It stores the distances between each community and the
central command post. The `haversine()` function is used to compute these
distances. The dictionary keys are the names of the communities, and the
values are the calculated distances. * **Sorting:** `optimal_sequence =
sorted(distances, key=distances.get)`: Sorts the communities (keys in the
`distances` dictionary) based on their distances to the command post. The
`key=distances.get` argument tells `sorted()` to use the values associated
with the keys in the `distances` dictionary as the sorting criteria. *
**Printing the Sequence:** A `for` loop iterates through the sorted sequence
(`optimal_sequence`). Inside the loop, `print(f"{i}. {community} - Distance:
{distances[community]:.2f} km")` is used to output the evacuation sequence in
a user-friendly format. It includes the index (`i`), the community name
(`community`), and the distance from that community to the command post,
formatted to two decimal places. **Output Analysis:** The output of the code
shows the sorted evacuation sequence along with the distances: 1\.
EastFieldsJunction - Distance: 7.84 km 2\. EastSpringsSettlement - Distance:
9.74 km 3\. RedPointTown - Distance: 9.81 km 4\. OakParkTown - Distance: 11.76
km This means that EastFieldsJunction is closest to the central command post,
followed by EastSpringsSettlement, RedPointTown, and finally OakParkTown. The
evacuation sequence would be EastFieldsJunction, then EastSpringsSettlement,
then RedPointTown, then OakParkTown. **Key Features:** * Use of the
`haversine` formula for distance calculation. * Dictionary data structure to
store community names and their distances. * `sorted()` function with a key
argument to sort based on dictionary values. * Formatted string output using
f-strings. ]Screenshot 2025-03-15 205444878×668 38.1

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Overall Image
Description:** The image shows a multiple-choice question related to an
evacuation strategy. It presents the coordinates of four communities (Oak Park
Town, East Springs Settlement, East Fields Junction, and Red Point Town) and a
central command post. The question asks for the optimal evacuation sequence
using the "nearest community first" strategy. Four possible sequences are
provided as answer options. There is also a code snippet shown using the
`haversine` library. **Key Elements:** * **Question Text:** * Identifies the
four communities by name and provides their coordinates (latitude, longitude).
* States the location of the Central Command Post. * Explains the evacuation
strategy: "nearest community first", where "nearest" is determined by the
shortest path distance from the command post to each community. * Asks for the
"optimal sequence for evacuating the communities." * **Answer Options:** Four
options are given each representing a different order in which the communities
can be evacuated. They all start and end with "Start/End". * **Code Snippet:**
A small code snippet is shown, importing the `haversine` library, which is a
library used to calculate distances between two points on a sphere given their
latitudes and longitudes. The code snippet also defines the `oakparktown`
coordinates. **In summary:** The image presents a problem of determining an
optimal evacuation order based on distances from a central point. ]Screenshot

In my case Please note the above two questions are asked to calculate pearson
correlation coefficient for KTM brand and for maharashtra and Karnataka
states.  
I have used excel to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient. Below the
values I got for each question. Please verify.

|pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention
for kTM brand for Karnataka||  
-0.026685695

|pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price
retention for kTM for karnataka||  
0.003953219

|pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price
retention for kTM for karnataka||  
-0.010839295

|pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention
for kTM brand for maharashta||  
0.029128825

|pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price
retention for kTM for Maharashtra||  
0.013019585

Dear sirs,  
I have question no 7 got marked as 0. Please check the question below and the
haversine distance for the given post comes to around 11.5 kms which is not
matccing with any of the options and I have selected the closest answer.
please check and let me know.  

[[Image description: Here's a breakdown of the image content: **Type:** The
image is a screenshot of a multiple-choice question from a test or online
assignment. **Content:** * **Question Text:** The question describes a
scenario where a wildfire threatens a rural mountain region, and emergency
services need to plan evacuation routes. It states that the Emergency
Management Center is located at a central command post. It provides the
coordinates (latitude and longitude) of four communities: * Pine Pines
Junction * Maple Fields Station * South Glen Crossing * Cedar Creek Retreat *
Central Command Post * The question then asks to use the Haversine package to
calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Pine Pines Junction
and select the most accurate distance from the multiple-choice options. *
**Multiple-Choice Options:** The options presented are: * 3848 meters * 6265
meters * 4110 meters * 5106 meters * **Feedback:** The image indicates that a
previous attempt was incorrect. It shows "No, the answer is incorrect. Score:
0". It also gives the "Accepted Answer" as 5106 meters. **Key elements for
answering the question (if one had to do it):** * Coordinates of Central
Command Post * Coordinates of Pine Pines Junction * Understanding that the
Haversine formula/package is needed to calculate the distance between two
points on a sphere given their latitudes and longitudes. In summary, the image
presents a problem involving geographic coordinates, distance calculation, and
selecting the correct answer from multiple choices. It also shows that a
previous attempt was incorrect, with the correct answer revealed.

I did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again
after being marked as incorrect

My question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and
emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote
communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command
post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and
safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community
: (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit
Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836)
& Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine
package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver
Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance

10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters,
which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the
destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question)

Also, my question 4 was :  
As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a
forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment,
considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027
resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.

134483

94774

150666

199711

Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was
approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again
turns out to be incorrect

So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according
to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)

Kindly look into it

Thanks and Regards

In Q4 , neither which regression model to use is given nor the what random
state to use is given. I tried linear regression, random forest regression but
it is giving answer which vary each time I compute, also, the option values
are quite close.

[[Image description: Here is a detailed description of the image: The image
presents a multiple-choice question related to forecasting motorcycle resale
values. **Content Breakdown:** * **Question:** The question is framed for an
investment analyst tasked with monitoring motorcycle resale values. It asks to
develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and
segment, factoring in seasonality and long-term trends. The specific task is
to forecast the 2027 resale value of a Hero - HF Deluxe in Punjab using
historical data. * **Multiple-Choice Options:** * 194515 * 185108 * 142646 *
152609 * **Feedback:** Below the multiple-choice options, there is feedback
indicating that the previously selected answer was incorrect. * **Score:** The
current score is 0. In summary, the image presents a forecasting problem with
specific conditions related to motorcycle resale values and provides multiple-
choice answers. The image also indicates that the user previously attempted
the question and answered incorrectly, resulting in a score of
0.]image1227×446 24 KB](https://europe1.discourse-
