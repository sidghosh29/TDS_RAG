[[Image description: Here's a detailed description of the image content,
focusing on text and relevant features: **Overall Layout** * The image appears
to be a screenshot of a web page, specifically an online quiz or assignment
platform. * The background color is a dark gray. * A red banner at the top
indicates the end date/time of the quiz. **Top Banner** * **Text:** * "Ended
at Fri, 21 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" * "Score: 0" * "Check all" * "Save" * The
"Check all" and "Save" buttons are interactive elements within the platform.
**Main Content Area** * **Heading:** "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation" *
**Instructions (numbered list):** 1\. "Learn what you need. Reading material
is provided, but feel free to skip it if you can answer the question. (Or
learn it, just for pleasure.)" 2\. "Check answers regularly by pressing Check.
It shows which answers are right or wrong. You can check multiple times." 3\.
"Save regularly by pressing Save. You can save multiple times. Your last saved
submission will be evaluated." 4\. "Reloading is OK. Your answers are saved in
your browser (not server). Questions won't change except for randomized
parameters." 5\. "Browser may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off
security restrictions or try a different browser." 6\. "Use anything. You can
use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any
libraries or frameworks you want." 7\. "It's hackable. It's possible to get
the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's
allowed." * **Discussion Link:** * A call to action with a chat bubble icon
reads "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse" linking to the
discussion about the task. * **User Information:** * "You are logged in as
23f3004238@ds.study.iitm.ac.in." * "Logout" button. * **Recent Saves:** *
Heading: "Recent saves (most recent is your official score)" * List of save
timestamps with score for each timestamp. * "Reload from 21/02/2025, 23:18:35.
Score: 9" * "Reload from 21/02/2025, 23:15:07. Score: 9" * "Reload from
21/02/2025, 23:03:00. Score: 8" **Key Observations and Inferences** *
**Subject:** The quiz/assignment is likely related to "Data Preparation" and
is part of a course or program with the identifier "TDS 2025 Jan GA5." *
**Allowed Resources:** The instructions explicitly state that users can use
any resources they want, including the internet, ChatGPT, friends, libraries,
and frameworks. * **Hacking Encouraged:** The instructions surprisingly allow
and even encourage "hacking" the code to find answers. * **Saving and
Reloading:** The platform saves answers in the browser, and reloading is
permitted. Only the last saved submission is evaluated. * **Scoring:** The
current score is 0, but recent saves indicate previous attempts with scores of
8 and 9. Let me know if you'd like a further breakdown of any specific part of
the image! ]Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.41.09 AM2940Ã—1912 443

Is this something to worry about?

This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves
section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history
because we log that.

Kind regards
